0:21:54 -  hey hi guys so um we good so I thought we'll just um the embedding story is going on for a long time so I thought we'll take a break and look at something more interesting um for a couple of days so I picked up a de planning course which previously I did I did like five or six courses when I got launched initially after that I didn't do I didn't do other courses but but this time again I want to do do this course deep learning this is going to be interesting because it's going to be agents which is one of my favorite topics and I believe strongly believe that's going to be the Fe of deep learning as well okay so not sure you can hear the audio of this uh video and stuff but um if you don't I I would actually suggest you can watch the videos on your own in of watching on my channel this is U deep learning short courses in which we have ai agents and langra that's what we're looking at right now for for for for e for for in for so this is the pattern in which it will be the nice part of it is it's not just about watching videos it also shows the notebook where you can execute it and understand how things work and stuff it has some it has some environment setup so we can't say we can download this and run it as is but um if we understand how this works we can set it up lo as well okay sh for that now that no h good for for e for for I for for h for for for for oh so noore don't I need to find aage for so let's uh walk through it once again to open API open AI client and then which model to use

0:25:2 -  messes will be R this is a sample of how it works chat completion method chat so far like R user and the content hello world the response is hello how can I assist you today create an agent where the agent call method what it does is whatever is being sent to it it will append that to messages whatever is execute is more like calling the open AI completion and then getting a response to it okay so when you call it it stores the message that is being sent executes the openi response and that response is also again Ro assistant content is stor that is called result given a message it passes to the open AI gets the response puts it there all of this is being stored in messages self. messages of the agent okay now you take a prompt it says you run a loop of thought action pause and observation so it's the agent to run this end of the loop you output an answer use start to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked your action to run one of the actions available to you then to return pause observation will be the result of running these actions so thought is the approach action is the action that people observation is actually more the response of the action and we're also defining it's not like Global actions we are restricting it to certain action so that it is under our control on what it can do so we're giving two actions is one is calculat is more like a math function and what needs to be done in stuff and second is an average dog weight method function where that function actually Returns the average of a dog when given the bre so this function calculate is Method average dog weight we'll see how it is implemented and stuff right here it here mentions uses python to be sure to use floating mod sytax if necessary this function definitions are not

0:28:41 -  written by people but we we telling them this how you need to do in language and then it's following it is nice example session we're giving it an example like uh this is f tuning method when we give examples like one example two multiple so how much does the dog weigh I should look the dog's weight using dog wait Bulldog pause called again with this buldog is then you're defining calculator aage do method this so we're doing calculate and average dog weight methods we're defining them in Python and putting them as non actions agent of prom we are getting a class of this prom input and we creating one instance of this agent starting off with that particular PR here then using this instance of the agent we are giving it a message and we're looking at how much does a toy P weigh for the average weight of a toy P using the average average thought action pause and then [Music] uh here's the pressure and he's calling a bot off like this instance is is using the call method so it will go here to this call method with this message it will append as user message it'll execute this and get the response and what should be the response of that particular so and uh when you execute so it takes all the messages that is the whole appendant message is what it will take and execute so if you go to chat GPT and you run this independently also you'll get the same behavior and we can see it how it is executing okay then we are calling manually the action here average dog weight and the result is a so the method calls response is this next we give that and next prompt with observation that is found in previous method call and we get the answer okay this is also every everywhere where you do abot call that is

0:31:41 -  a um it's the open ey response aot of is always a open ey response for example here agent of prompt B this is initialization that is is method that is here so system system system system then messes open so this is only first one here it is not called init method so post this is Method post that from here it is call method so call method every it adds this message and also calls the use the response of it so and we are in the call method we are wring the result result is nothing but the execution response not the messages so this content that is there messages but it Isen this is this message plus the previous messages that together are being called to open a so if you look at Mage you understand first it went It Go B system and it took the initial init prompt right RO system content this is uh the this method okay then we call how much does a toy P weigh so that will be here rooll user content how much does the tood this is passed to the open AI along with this prompt this prompt and this question these two are sent then the role assistant that is the response from open a thought I should look up the average weight of a to model because we asked it to do like this thought action pause observation it will do thought and uh action and pause okay and not [Music] the did it do any thought action pause and stop without doing observation those actions [Music] so in the actions we need to see okay so uh sorry so you have what did it do wait okay assist it gave this approach then user observation type is we did a function call and in the function call response we gave it as observation as

0:35:28 -  input to this the output expectation of the output is thought and then uh action pause and observation so it gave us thought action and pause and it stopped previous response now we are adding observation to it and passing it now it has observation it has completed the loop once it is completed the loop obvious next step is to show an answer so it has shown the answer so we can making it little complicated than straightforward as it is have two dogs and then he has given it then he has asked the question then uh and the average weight of both this is first action interesting part is uh it has a list of actions to do it's only printing the first action because you say here use action to run one of the actions available to you then return pause observation will be the result of rning those actions so one of the actions he's taking that is here and pause then Lally is pause it is pausing the generation awesome nice then we are adding the observation okay by calling the method OB here and the observation and U when the observation is given this is call the next one but it not give answers but gives the next action because we clearly said only after the completing the loop that is completing Loop is not only about observation but also the actions the list of actions that are there that should also be done it knows the second action because it has the first prompt it has the question and then it has the first action that is performed so now logically it is able to understand what is the second action and that's how it's picking up the second action there okay we should print the system messes for this then you'll understand but let me observation is 57 next action is calator 7 20 okay I didn't understand why he here instead he could called the calculate makes more to ID whether whether given thing is action or not we were manually calling these right so inste he's putting in a loop whatever we did he

0:40:58 -  just coded it and they also set some Max return turns like how many turns should we go to perform because it could be five actions 10 actions it could be any actions right so to make sure that we completed in certain iterations so here said set max turns for Regent prom question initial question is given so for five times he's is a traing this counting the five bot is the agent so bot he is giving the next problem so he's getting the list of actions and action matches the action format like this oh no no a [Applause] loop he splitting it and then looking there other he's keeping actions okay if actions action action input no actions list of actions that he's convered method call so that means like either calculator average dog weight will be here coming out here then for that he is calling a method action input and the observation is converting into next prompt and it will go to the loop and next prom will be observation after observation if there is any next action that will come in if it is I mean understanding if it is one action or multiple actions it will do it from here and for actions it will take the input and then print it here for our [Music] understanding we can also print actions here okay let's let's change the this thing also what are the dogs that are there tole I can give anything actually so one I will give to P other I will give some random okay A P in saying to P say p okay it not work because it's a meod let's see let's read okay I'm just getting making it up what is the difference weights is my question okay this is my prompt thought I need to find the average weight of you thought it an average what is difference in difference oh because he's saying average weight because he always calls he's correct he saying average weight of

1:63:24 -  B and average weight of difference between the weights okay action average weight of B first actions s lbs thought I have and this is interesting when he says average weight of ble and he does observation he's calling this method right oh name in so it's like list and name in so it is matching okay cool even if I say toy it will work okay so theage of pause Street do 50 L because it's going to the other option I know have more on this actions action second action third action is calculate 15 minutes on 43 empty and understand nice but here the methods are manually given actions we didn't use the it's okay so it's more like um if you want a program besides the you have some methods to run and stuff besides using LM we also using combination of LM and the user methods kind of stuff okay um should we go to the next lesson or should we continue tomorrow it's interesting want to go to the next lesson but um let's go oh man this is 19 minutes so we'll cross the time but let's see concentrate okay minute he's explaining so let's concentrate on the video for for I'll just be back one second let's go for all for right that that for sh right for e I for br for now get I what I all I that's [Music] right for is for for for for for for
