0:9:53 -  e okay hello hello oh my God man okay okay I think um I think the voice is clear so this is manually operated so if this if this goes up it's mute and then un mute kind of stuff so I keep uh forgetting that you should bring it down okay so it has come out pretty well so let's continue there that's one thing that we'll do second thing is we'll revise on we don't revise but let's just focus on at least listing because uh I have I don't have much time today I'll I'll focus on listing the whole topics that uh matter of fact listing the whole topics I could do offline also I don't want to do it on the video but we'll see basing on the time availability we'll see what we could cover okay so let me share the screen and get started so yesterday till now we have completed B gradient distance stas gradient distance mini batch momentum nestro AEL gradient add a RMS prop Dela Adam so we should continue with nadam that is uh mine so for for [Music] start for for for for so he said nestro steps to this one but let's see this was very simple this dir dirty oh this is not complete this is wrong for oh that is correct okay so let's go back and focus on the NM part of it Adam equation comparing with the oh so he is coning both he's coning um is's coning the actual equation is M1 by squ root of VT + Epsilon for Adam uh for Adam it is Mt into 1 - 1 by 1 - beta t + 1 minus beta 1 I think it is beta 1 t uh beta 1 T not beta 1 power T not beta

0:19:48 -  1 T it's beta down part okay Mt already has 1 minus beta under 1us beta but even if it is look ahead look ahead should be look ahead is should be in this direction saying if uh Theta T is = to Theta t th t - 1 = th t - 2 - Alpha into m t byun of v t + Epsilon and one more step in the direction so one more step in the direction will give us what [Music] he says one more step in the direction is Theta tus1 + beta 1 into mtus 1 how is that and that to plus is plus coming in okay let's try that uh okay let's look at the [Music] M1 this is [Music] clear got confused no no no it's correct for for for C [Music] something e for e multiplying with 1 minus beta 1 will this is not correct I he multiplying withus beta one here why is there empty test equation [Music] [Music] [Music] no this is not uh correct how is the look Ahad Cal okay this is nice math behind Adam Optimizer oh it doesn't have access pting attack [Music] oh we don't have C anywhere okay let's look at uh Bas [Music] okay only mm he's bringing in and keeping it here okay but why is he multiplying with this even if he goes with [Music] empty it'll be Mt root of +on but he's only considering Mt minus one okay if he

0:27:19 -  cons only Mt then come one step further will be beta 1 and to mtus1 Plus data t oh this will make it [Music] zero beta 1 minus beta 1 by 1us beta 1 okay [Music] pyro is here so Theta T = Theta t - 1 - Alpha the Adam equation is Mt by square root of VT plus Epsilon correct inside out do and uh so he's saying look ahead TAA look ahead is = to Theta T -1 + beta 1 m p minus one how did he come with this equation is the question correct and he is also let's see he computes Mt and VT with the new ones even if it does doesn't actually look Ahad this where uh s two should be one more step in the direction means Theta tus 2 plusus where empty changes the changes as beta 1 beta 1 m t yeah bet on Mt + 1us b 1 derivative of J of data [Music] t r look ahead by square root of I'm assuming VT is not changed VT minus Epsilon plus Epsilon so now what will happen to [Music] this oh forgot it should also be divided by 1us Beta T if it is divided 1us bet again

0:32:17 -  like this piece of it it is / 1 - beta 1 power [Music] T then okay this is the equation that we would get if we do something but let's look at this guy what is he doing um m t into minus beta 1 to^ T into 1us beta 1 power t + 1 - bet 1 into [Music] differential of J th look [Music] so let [Music] [Music] m is equal to m t by 1 - beta power T 1 power t [Music] in same direction is taking of theta T minus [Music] 1 look ahead in the same direction what will become the new data look ahead if he does a step in same direction what will be the Theta values Theta lad is equal to Theta T minus 1 Theta T minus 1 isal to Theta T minus 2 minus Alpha M tus1 by square root of V T minus 1 + Epsilon correct if you go one more step doing there in nag if you look at it if you go there go back to Nag on the medium nag nag nag nag mini batch yeah nag is TA look atad this TAA

0:38:21 -  tus1 minus beta BTUs 1 so normally it is um so momentum is uh oh this is uh this is not momentum this is actually mini batch this is mini bat we should have added the equation of momentum beta is parameter beta this term is common plus beta V 0 plus beta of the previous one is what is being considered here so coming to nag instead of taking beta take look at this Theta look ahead this daa tus One beta VT minus one previously not U so it's it's not a complete step it is just a partial step [Music] yeah so previously it is uh so Theta T in previous scenario is Theta T minus1 minus VT and before that is Theta T minus 1 is Theta tus 2 minus V T minus1 now look ahead of this will be Theta tus 1 is equal to Theta tus 2 minus V so new new VT minus one will become beta into v t minus1 plus Alpha into derivative of alpha of J Theta T minus one new where replacing VT minus one actual VT minus one is VT minus 2 now we don't want DT minus 2 into this equation so this term is fine look ahead this time is fine this time coming in is fine course minus V but minus Alpha J Theta that's going away

0:51:16 -  so VT new is equal to time to V on Old plus Alpha [Music] into for e so this piece is going away how moving one step further in that direction s previously it is T 2 - 2 [Music] oh V T minus 1 is = this will become plus actually maybe this is this correct is what we need to look at once again let see person will be C [Music] Al into is a momentum is optim that looks ahead to where the parameter will be calculated the gradient X post rather than x and that is T minus f I got it because B T minus 2 minus Alpha J Theta minus 2 will be there so beta if he gives here Al Tal classical momentum and mag m v t + one e for I'll This Kiss yeah this will not work this is different so this is another puzzle piece we should break okay so nag is a combination of uh is combination of n where we use data look ahead for cost from previous step instead of using data T minus one the equation I've done the deration here here that's the point that's where I'm missing the whole game it's not TAA T minus one it is TAA T minus 2 and further dividing it that's where I'm always going wrong Theta look ahead is equal to Theta tus1 minus beta vtus one so one more step that

1:63:5 -  means Theta in this equation Theta tus one minus MP square root of a minute what is this guy saying in in the okay what is this guy saying in the equation Theta look atad is Theta T minus 1 plus beta 1 into m t minus1 correct so Theta tus1 is nothing but Theta T minus 2 minus uh is Alpha into [Music] m t - 1 by squ root of v t - 1 + Epsilon Plus beta 1 M tus 1 so Thea t - 2 minus it's okay going back on Alpha into or if you combine these two mtus beta 1 minus yunk of p t - 1 + Epsilon into Alpha minus beta 1 into square root of tus 1 + Epsilon [Music] oh this is not plus this is minus minus and uh this is plus this is Plus for [Music] there it is 1+ beta into tus [Music] one one more step here it is uh it should be actually then it will become Alpha should also be there right this is something that you didn't understand because VT had Alpha here but whereas in this V doesn't have Alpha anyways for for for for for for than for m for M2 isal to beta 1 into

1:81:3 -  1 time this is clear no this doesn't make sense let me write it man big deal empty is equal to write the other way oneus beta 1 [Music] into for for for for for for for for for next data that's correct [Music] so only thing that is look this this is so it will be wa [Music] only Min we use the whole of it then it will be from alpha plus beta there should be Alpha time as well I don't know why he didn't include Alpha but um fine for for for I don't I it's to handle the infinity now put now a second oh all of them is it Max off happy oh because zero okay okay for adx generation from nor for oh that way okay okay it's clear this is clear this is nice also here he did very good but why what is the infinity [Music] problem for oh because 1- beta 2 T is not required he's putting Alpha by 1us Beta T1 Mt by why update the exponential update the exponential weighted Infinity normal instead of the second term he's saying update [Music] exponential so greatest of the gradients is being div taken for division instead of uh taking the square of the gradients greatest of the gradients is being taken yeah X taking Adam equation taking Adam equation um M

1:88:40 -  10 and VT BT which is basing on square of GR is replaced with maximum UT which takes the maximum rent value of the past at the present UT is equal to Max of first let's uh take this one okay capture it put it here now if you look at [Music] UT is equal to Max of uh let's call the gradient GT minus one GT minus one uh that's equalent to Max of beta 2 [Applause] [Music] uh 2 into UT minus one will be again Max of tus 2 and G T minus 2 this will be again Max of this one so it'll so it will become beta 2 into max of previous relatively Max of overall gradience as you see UT is Max of approximately multiplication applied we can say direct Max [Music] but it is the max okay sounds good so okay let's put Adam accelerations also so that it will be more clear I think for this we need to keep because this is important one more yeah one more there [Music] so if Adam Max is
