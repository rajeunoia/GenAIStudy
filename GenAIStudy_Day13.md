0:2:33 -  hey hi guys so yesterday we have completed um the um I'm not very comfortable saying we've completed um the svm matter of fact we are supposed to look at both classif and regression because class fair is where we were actually taking the points and then putting a putting this plane in between and um but whereas uh um we didn't even Explore on how the regressor sorry the spvm regressor will work so that's um pending um we'll see I'll have the svm on list so that I'll explore on the equation or maybe one day we could spend on uh watching some some video on svm which is more detailed with the math explained and stuff so that uh we can actually see how um the spvm equation is derived how the loss is calculated so any any model that you take the the sing the overall process will be same now I think now by now you should understand you are being given a data which is X1 X2 X3 something you try to understand the pattern in it which is nothing but the whole learning process to represent the pattern you you come up with an equation and different algorithms has different equation linear regession has its own equations logistic has its own equation de has its own equation um equation is very simple it's it's just X1 S1 is equal to four or something that right then um svm has its only equation so [Music] um okay let's think of Na base it's a probability that we calculate and basing on probability of each feature we calculate is it's can we say yeah see end of the day something which says where we derive some value basing on calculation you can call it as a

0:5:10 -  equation but not algebric Al not algebric algebric I don't know if there's a word called algebric but um algebra based equation um probable probability based equation um so again so it's always equation and we see what is the pattern in the and then we try to see how far this equation derives a pattern or aligns with the pattern in the data if it's not aligning we calculate how much it's not aligning that is what we call as loss or cost um and uh then our objective will be to reduce that particular loss or cost in a way that um the cost is minimal the loss is minimal uh so we should understand forvm classifier and address also you should understand what is the kind of equations that they use and stuff on how they derive how they pick up the plane and how they the loss how they calculate the margin all that we should understand okay we'll look into it sometime now moving forward till now we have learned um all of them are supervised machine learning so they're also unsupervised uh if you guys I'll just quickly repeat on what is difference between supervised and unsupervised supervised is something where supervisor is like you you we have an exam and um um I mean I I don't know how many of you guys know but there's something called a question Mar Okay so what happens people when they need to prepare for an exam they'll they'll have a like an F use or question bank and where they refer to all the questions that are possible there and what the answers that are there they go through all that questions answers and stuff later they will be given a question paper which need not necessarily has the same question as what is there in question back but the concepts might might be similar so the whole um evaluation or challenge is going to be how can a person answer these questions basing on the question Banks

0:8:13 -  questions and answers okay so that is actually a good example of what is a supervised learning okay now coming to unsupervised learning um unsupervised learning is like um you are not explicitly given What that particular thing is so you try to um like the questions are overall given but the answers are not given this in UNS supervised scenario but what you do looking at the question you should for example for a school student if you mix up all the questions like Math Science Social um or um like English um Spanish something like that if you have all these questions then um basing on the question we can segregate saying okay this is math question this is science question so you look at the question you see what are the terms ter in it and stuff and then you see which subject is closest to the terms is it math is it science is it language you you see which is the closest and you you put that question into that particular bucket saying okay this is math question you put it into math bucket and this is science question you put it into science bucket like that you segregate right so here it is unsupervised because you don't you are not given a training data or features which has corresponding y you have been given just the features and you've been asked to learn on top of it so you don't you're not given why then how do you learn on top of it doesn't make sense right so um the key problem here is you don't know what is the right answer right then how do you derive a right answer right so that's a good problem to solve right so we will look at we ask CH GP on once and what is the different kind of uh um unsupervised learnings that are there of five [Music] algorithms g means clustering hierarchal clustering principal comp

0:10:57 -  analysis project [Music] dat simp component analysis is a unsupervised learning technique okay we'll look at what is PC also today density based spatial clustering of applications with again Auto encoders on network AR use for on learning they consist of encod representation [Music] input from encoding learn to encod they Capt [Music] theine we will cover Auto encoders but not now Auto encoders will come in uh closure to NLP and gen we'll we learn it at that point of time so Auto encoders will not be con if you look at the remaining most of them is clustering algorithm so un super is primarily clustering what is the meaning of clustering is um clusters are not nothing but um uh a group of things which has certain similarity or certain purpose or or so are actually usually put together into one cluster okay so the cluster is used in multiple things in computer science like kubernetes Big Data Solutions like Haro and all that stuff has clusters I mean the cluster term could also be used in different forms and different Technologies and Frameworks and stuff but Prim it is uh the meaning of it is very similar that is a cluster is nothing but a grouping of um certain um you can say data certain um certain servers or something like that together which either are used for a common purpose or which are used by specific application this is there is some commonality or relation between those uh so they are put into a specific cluster so um what happens

0:13:28 -  here in nonsupervised learning the clustering process and stuff so they we create clusters we don't know uh what is the Y so we can't so previously we know what is a y so we can label it basing on apples oranges and saying let's say these are all apples let's say we put it in red color and these are all oranges we can keep it in orange color and and then we our Target will be to predict a pattern which where the pattern segregates if it's a classification problem then the pattern which segregates these two apples and oranges so that um boundaries so that it it it comes in when something comes in we'll see just look at the boundary right which side of the boundary is it on the Apple side of the boundary or is it on the orang side of the boundary so we just put the point and see okay it's on the left side of the boundary it's apple right side of the boundary it is similar right so that's with supervisor the vised you don't know you've been given all fruits and you don't know what is the names of the fruits or something that right so let's assume you're a you're a small kid and you don't know all the fruits yet like you have been not been taught different FS like like like me I I for some reason it's it's it's not so good to say but for some reason I still can't uh name or identify all the vegetables and majority of the fruits I I don't know what's the names andu so now somebody like me if I have been given a basket full of fruits and sweets sweets vegetables with me then how do I uh segregate them or how do I understand the pattern in them so what I do because if I know the name if I know the names are if I know so um super if it supervised what will happen is um people will actually give me some pictures or some some kind of a reference data kind of stuff um for example um I'm just imagining supervisor on supervisor again I'm reting just just just to make sure you guys are have a closure understanding let's say it's a supermarket like like a grocery store and there's already vegetables and

0:15:59 -  fruits kept in all the slots right you can imagine they're all kind of boxes and where the vegetables and fruits are already kept so if it's supervised they are already placed in those baskets and uh all I need to do is I I I've been given a truck and then in which we we container G stuff which has all the vegetables and fruits so I go there I'll I'll look at everything to understand okay what is at least uh okay I'll look at some everything and then I'll maybe I'll Identify some things like okay um what color what size uh how is it what shape and um and all that I I'll recognize some pattern for each of them and what I'll do um and now once I I pick up my container I I'll I'll basing on the knowledge that I gain uh that that whatever I'm looking at is called is is nothing but our training and basing on training whatever I whatever features that I capture and um I I segregate okay I think this section is all um is all about vegetable this section is all about fruits um if I know if I don't know different story but at least I can say okay uh if it's red then most of the reds are there so I should go there first and then look for Reds if it's something round then it is here some some some segregation I'll know because they're already there okay so from the container I'll pick up something and then I'll basing on my memory uh of of information that I have uh saying okay all the reds are on on right side corner and then I'll go there I'll try to put it there right so uh similarly I'll segregate all of them and just in case if there is something which I can't um map it to the like to the data then what I do I'll I'll just um um I'll just see what is the closest to it and then we'll I'll put it there correct so um that's one way second way is unsupervised if it is what happens is

0:18:35 -  you've been given um you are you come to the grocery store you've been given a container but once you go there you are the first person or like that's the first thing you're doing in the morning and and last night they would have taken off all the things that are there now the challenge is um you don't have a reference you have don't have a training data you can't um uh you you can't learn from something you can't identify certain features you can't identify certain patterns uh basing on which you can segregate and and and uh put it right so that's not possible so then what we we could the best we can do is uh one thing we should agree on is we can't label them because we don't know we are not trained we don't know what is what we don't even know what are all possible scenarios for example what are all the fruits the what kind of fruits what do the fruit different fruit names are there I don't know what are the different vegetable names that are there I don't know so giving it a specific name is called labeling or or a class or a name or a value is is is called labeling so we we can't label it uh so um that's not possible so that's kept aside what you could do you could do is you what you have is the container of vegetables and fruits so you can actually pick up and see okay what is what is similar right like all the orange ones you put it in one place within orange all the green ones you put it in one place and then within green you can actually distinguish as you add more features to it uh green and round uh green and um green and long and um again green and long with um with a circular shape um green and long with a um and green and long with the uh thin thinner ones green and long and bigger ones like that you could have multiple um segregations right so and you segregate them and you keep it you don't label them but you segregate them and you put it into different there are racks you can put them into different racks kind of stuff but you can't label them but somebody with only supervised can come and label them so your supervisor maybe he'll come and then label it um there could also be mistakes

0:21:7 -  uh in that maybe few of the vegetables you you might have mixed up or something like that right so but still without knowing you are segregating it that's this is what is clustering uh is too long to explain clustering but I hope you guys got it so let's look at K's clustering as one of the clustering algorithms um the remaining clustering might have a different approach it's again it's evolving in non supervis learning also you they would have started with one one way of how they can cluster and then they would have improved the process further so that you will learn it better way right so now coming to C's clustering um what do they do and how does it work and stuff we can again I inad of going with things on top of my head I'll I'll try to refer a blog or something like that and then I've also found something interesting where where you have uh um visualization as well which which is nice actually visualizations are nice people speaking and I using my hands and saying things is different and us visualizations are much more you can learn it better that's that's actually people prefer visualization but uh this is not I mean the whole study time is for me to study it's it's not focused on visualizations or to show people what it means and stuff somebody can learn out of it it's very nice but that's okay uh came in frering so supervised machine learning algorithms uh we just quickly skim through it because we just need to understand what it means but we don't need to get into the details of how it is calculated or something like that um a cluster refers to a collection of data points segregated together because of certain similarity okay which is which is um so what you'll do you'll Define a target number K which defers to the number of centroids you need in the data set a centroid is imaginary at real location representing the center of the cluster okay so um he should have put it in a better way that is you decide on how many clusters you want to make okay for example in our previous example example of fruits and vegetables if you say two then probably you might end up saying all fruits and all vegetables kind of stuff that that could be your intent basing on that intent you could

0:23:45 -  say or let's say if somebody would have told you boss uh when he gave you container he would have told you like there are total six variety of vegetables and um May four variety of fruits something like that right they would have told you then you have at least a reference number saying okay as per what this guy told me there are nine which of which six um did I say did I say yeah okay what what five variety of vegetables and four variety of fruits so it's nine so we have total nine so then the K that you see here will be nine and uh so your objective is to create nine clusters so you start off picking up nine centroids uh nine centroids which are croid as he was saying it's imaginary number but our Target is that will be that should be a center of the cluster so nine points will create nine clusters basing on those points and stuff so um what they do how do they calculate we we look at it uh K number of centroids and then allocates every data points to the nearest cluster keeping as small as possible so what they do initially the randomly take we we'll get to the point saying how we can pick up the points but let's say they randomly take the nine points and they put it I mean okay to bring from the real world problem to the data problem right when you come to machines machines can't um machines work on data right so of course with the latest Trend and stuff you can actually put in um you can put in a a humanoid kind of stuff which has Vision it can look at this container which has vegetables and uh fruits and it can actually um it's assume the same thing if it doesn't know what is the name of it uh it can also look at and then say what what what did we identify when we were doing it we were actually identifying the features right um saying what color is it what shape is it how long is it um what size is it is it large is it big is it small so there are multiple features that you extract um from uh U from the data and basing on

0:26:24 -  the features you you you you know what that uh particular uh what is the data point that we can assign to that particular feature and you can represent the data point let's assume um okay I'm also going in that pattern saying uh um thought is um there are multiple features if you have been given with data with multiple features if you pick up centroid uh okay that that will be also be multi I think the centroid then will also be multi-dimensional that is X1 X2 X3 X4 or something like that then how do you calculate the so this what something this is a good question to ask we'll ask CH GPT later on but to start off let's say I take one feature and then um and then I'll pick up centroid for that one feature like I I pick up K 9 values within those particular thing one thing is for sure I I I can randomly pick the points but I'll just make sure that the points are within the scope of the points that are there like let's say the range of the points that you have for the feature X1 across all is is in between uh um let's say it's from 10 to 200 okay then that's your range so you even if you pick random points you don't usually pick something outside that scope because of course your your your clusters are supposed to be within 10 to 200 right you don't you're not expecting it to be outside the range it could be outside the range a little bit um but you're primarily your at least your clustering should have this Androids within this 10 to 200 boundary kind of stuff right so uh then what we do after picking up the points is these random points these nine points we'll actually see [Music] um what is the distance in between um these nine points and all the data that means so what happened on on a given plane like this we have all these 10 to plane level is let's say 10 to 200 we we have all these values right

0:28:58 -  distributed in in 10 to 200 in um in a plane right so those 10 to 200 points we we keep we kept like nine dots within the 10 to 200 points and um to this nine dots for every point to this nine dots we can calculate the distance right so what we do um first of all we'll see within this 9 point Point whatever what which point is closest like every Point has certain distance with these nine points and we will see which point is closest to that whichever is the closest to that and we call them centroids like nine centroids right so which each centroid we'll see which which point is closest to that and then let's say nine of them has nine different colors then what we do um whichever is closest we'll assign that particular color that is cluster coloring is nothing but clustering so we our objective is to nine clusters but nine clusters how do we come at the first time is you put random nine points and for each point you you calculate distance for all the points that are there then that tells you like which for a given point on the on the space which is the nearest centroid and you you tag it around with the centroid like Cent let's say C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C9 then I'm closes to C4 then I become C4 C4 clust Androids cluster like that you you you assign certain clusters to all of them um but these are random points they may or may not be um a proper division right like let's say out of your nine points in the space four four of them are in one place and five of them are another place then um or let's say majority like six of them in one place and then two of them are one place what majority of the points will be closer to these two points point and and the six points will actually are dividing specific area into smaller points so this is not something that we want so we will try to um we need to try to move the centroid in a way that it actually has proper clustering okay so what we do the in the K means so algorithm this cluster while keeping the center as small as possible okay the means in the the came in first averaging of the data that is finding the

0:31:32 -  centroid so what they do you put nine random points you assign um you you basing on the distance finding out the nearest centroid you you you now got nine clusters basing on the points are closest to this nine points you can actually visualize right I I'll show show you in visualization as well then what we do uh learning data the C algorithm and data mining starts with a first group of random which are used as the beginning points for every cluster perative to Cal it creating an optimizing when either the croid have stabilized there is no change in their values because the clustering the identifi number of atts has beened okay okay he's getting there but the key point is um um for a given cluster after this nine points being Al um they take an average of that average of that particular uh points right and uh and pick up that average that mean of the whole points as the next Cent you guys got what I'm saying right so um now randomly we put nine points then nine points could be um Nine co are could be on Corners all nine points could be in one place or something like that right so what we need to do is we our objective is to create nine clusters in a way that the centroid is expected to be on the center of the particular cluster and these clusters are uh are proper segregations with with minimal overlapping or something like that right so and we also don't want these clusters to be like one cluster becoming pretty big and other clusters being very small kind of stuff that's not a proper classification then what happens most of your points that come that come in where you need to predict which cluster it belongs to we'll go to the big cluster right so we need to avoid it so to avoid it we we take this point on how we move the centroids um in a way that they actually um capture only certain set of the points so when you visualize you can we can actually see how it um uh changes but when do we stop it like okay you move it and again you calculate the

0:33:59 -  distances between uh uh all the points and then you you segregate the points basing on this K points K centroids and uh again you move it so um you you if you remember the previous Point means if you every time you calculate If You observe saying your mean is either very close are same uh that means you are already have segregated your your K clusters have been formed in a way that you can't they're already dividing the cids in a position that they can't move further you have already put them in a way that they are already representing their closest points with their clusters kind of stuff um basing on the means you you you can't me move them away so that means you you you are at a you have concluded on the clustering P part of it okay we'll see an example not this one as I said I have found a you another page where visually they're showing you on this visualizing K in clustering which is nice I just found it just now so how to pick the initial andrs that's what is the exercise right so let's say we'll do randomly first um which is what the M computer would do and second time when we restart we'll we'll pick uh I'll I'll choose it okay and what kind of data would you like to see these are all different kind of data [Music] even I don't know how it uh really works but to I think easier ones to have lesser complication um we'll go with packed circles so you know how they are so for this if you look at it itself you can actually form clusters right 1 2 3 4 five 6 7 so [Music] uh 7 clusters is what ideally would we would Target and uh okay then ads Androids um I can also okay I can't pick is it I should be able to pick it I thought okay so you should make a choice on how many you can add it seems so I added one

0:36:32 -  two 3 4 5 6 7 so you see what happened all these yellow is dominating yellow and to some extent gray are dominating remaining all points are distributed like that but if you as per of visual clustering it should be uh six boxes around six circles kind of hexagons or something like that around and then there is one here is meaning is circles actually but yeah seven should be lying that way so let's say we say we go so what happened basing on the points as I said he has uh Lael them okay so so what would he would have done is he would have calculated the distance between the given points to all the seven points and this yellow points are nearest to Yellow centroid and uh so what would happen let's say let's say give this point this point to Yellow Centro distance and this point to gr centroid distance visually if you see it appears like it is almost in the center uh but when the value is calculated it seems the distance between this let's say it's X and this is X1 or this is X2 then the distance X1 is less than X2 that's the reason yellow Point has come into this one so like that's how you get it then what I did what I said these are centroids that we picked correct out of all these points what we do we we calculate a mean and that mean point will also come on this somewhere right so that is where we should move so if You observe all the points now the black gray yellow red and all that click on updates Androids then they If You observe them they'll move yellow point is here for example let's focus on yellow Point yellow point is here uh then when we click on updates and it will move see it moved it is here um as we already know the solution is it close to what it is it is not but uh once it is moved the see the ls I mean he's visually giving us but ideally we don't know which is uh the

0:39:1 -  yellow coverage path but he's visually telling us this could be the boundary so as per his classification the distances now with the mood one is the uh these yellow points that you see 1 2 3 and uh this yellow Point these yellow points if you see this this should become gray dis closer to this this should become black this should become blue this this all should become red like that right so now if I say we assign points that's what you'll see see this has become gray [Music] black so it became nearest right nice now again you can again you calculate basing on these points you calculate the mean so if you say update Androids it has calculated the mean once it has calculated the mean um it is moved that particular points there um then if you see see the yellow points there are yellow points that are coming in on this color there are few yellow points coming in this blue gray and stuff so those points will again be moved there um similarly there are gray points which are coming into yellow so similar segregation is happening where the points are moving closure to the new Cent so we reassign point change them again updates and rights okay and then again we reassign points updates Androids PSN points updates Androids PN points updates Androids and points so if you see observe now we are almost at a state where we are uh we got the uh thing like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 this is what we want but a little bit of cows are there in the blue and so now sorry I should reassign points now if I reassign the point now you can actually see they proper state but still I can keep going but what will happen eventually what should happen eventually is um if that's how the Clusters are are there even if I updat Android it will adjust a little bit it will not move further see now I'm clicking on and if you guys can see I'm clicking on it but there is no movement that means the centroids are already moved to a position with where it is um uh where
