00:00:02	hey um hi everyone so good morning today it's um going to be day two um of our study time for generative AI um yesterday day one we have um completed the intro to AI um actually we are supposed to go through some kind of a course blog materials kind of stuff U we learned it with chat GPT to some extent which is not um it doesn't cover extensively a larger scope but um the thinking the other way I felt it is good um instead of um instead of going in a high speed trying to put in a lot of content into it and

00:00:47	stuff um it is better to go in the baby steps and then we we go bigger because usually people do that people say okay I'll watch this one hour video on generative Ai and then I'll understand everything or I'll watch this half an hour video on machine learning and I'll become a machine learning expert or something like that um or this they want us talk about it after um looking at that half an hour or 1 hour video um you might talk about it it you could start a conversation but what happens is when when you talk to a real person who

00:01:24	knows AI who uses machine learning and stuff um it's it's the only the first intro line or something like that way you start off your conversation anything where they go to the second layer you don't you can't step into the conversation kind of stuff so it is better to go I mean it's it all depends on why you're learning right it's if you're learning for that single conversation or just to um for a specific conference or to to maybe greet a people that's another that's one way where you you understand the basics of

00:02:00	it and you're good with it but um if you are somebody who wants to build a career in this space you want to learn it so that you can you apply it somewhere practically then the approaches um approaches to go in baby steps it would take time that's that's the lesson people learn in a hard way they try to rush they try to do a crash course they try to do an one hour video and then try to learn things but the fact is that the you you can't learn AI being a Bast subject you can't learn AI in in in this crash course or something

00:02:41	like that to an extent that you can actually build some level of expertise or you can start applying it or or thinking it like that the majority of the AI application comes in thinking than applying because applying piece is very easy because you if you know what to apply how to apply you you can actually even ask generate way and say okay um guys I want to implement a random Forest algorithm to solve the specific problem set of data which has these many categories and stuff if you if you give it it gives you all the code

00:03:15	and stuff so applying writing an algorithm and applying it to a specific problem statement um even including data exploration or data cleansing all this process you can actually ask Genera AI on what it is so maybe one day I'll explain you on how how I have really done it how or we can actually pick up a problem and do it using along with chat GPT we can actually try to solve that problem machine learning problem and see um how it really works okay um so so baby steps so today's uh topic as we have seen

00:03:51	yesterday it is um primarily about um basics of machine learning that's what chpd asked us to cover for today um quick uh B I understand it is it is very difficult to cover anything about machine learning uh and and I strongly suggest machine learning is one specific area you should spend more time because that is underlying basic foundation and uh for everything about it like it could be deep learning it could be um it could be llms it could be anything that you take above uh they are all one way the other way correlated to

00:04:35	machine learning and machine learning gives you a a perspective of what the whole AI is going towards so and uh what is the whole intelligence concept of it will be very clear okay so that being said let me get into the details on on the machine learning that is there I'll share my screen so this is what we have covered yesterday and this is the plan that J GPT has suggested us to more specific and also pick up specific topics okay so we'll start off with basics of machine learning today then um what is

00:05:46	learning okay [Music] [Music] name need these are these are definitely good questions um I would actually also tell what are the most used [Music] so we start off with um so before getting into machine learning I I thought like yeah forgot about machines learning what is learning so how would I learn how would humans learn or how would I think around whatever learn so that's a good question um yesterday we were actually discussing we repeated it twice it took more time where we once we we discussed about it

00:07:08	and then we asked CH GP on the similar questions and then we read through it I felt it it took a lot of time so um and I also felt both of the both of us were actually going very close by so today I would I'm thinking I should start off with chat GPT um and then come back here so let's go to chat GPD and understanding intelligence right what is learning learning is the process of acquiring knowledge skills Behavior or attitudes through experience study observation or instruction okay let's it says acquiring knowledge skills

00:08:06	Behavior are attitudes that is nice I like attitude so applying to context of humans they bring attitude they learn attitude uh acquiring attitude okay through experience study observation or instruction either you experience it to learn either you study it like a book or a blog or something or You observe it you look at what things happen and um are instruction so you follow certain instructions and completing the instructions will in turn tell you okay the instruction one two three are done in this order this is what happens kind

00:08:52	of stuff so that's that's the way we learn is what it is trying to say it involves acquisition retention and utilization of information are abilities that enable individuals to adopt grow and improve over time interesting learning can occur in various forms and contexts including formal education informal learning experiences social interactions and self-direct Explorations I think this is this line I like it and I would actually highly encourage every parent out there to realize it because okay that's a different topic I

00:09:38	don't want to go there but yeah this is this is important key aspects of learning include acquisition learning involves obtaining new information Concepts or learning so I think learning and intelligence uh are obviously are are overlapping the discussion that we had on intelligence yesterday I think learning comes like kind of a phase one of of getting to intelligence because without crossing the line of learning you don't get to intelligence right obviously yeah that's obvious thing so acquisition learning involves obtaining

00:10:17	new information Concepts or skills through exposure to stimulate our experiences retention learning invols storage and retention of all the skills in memory yeah understanding learning goes beyond memorization to Encompass comprehension of Concepts principles or processes understanding enables individuals to make connections solve problems and apply knowledge in various context okay very good adaptation learning facilties adaptation to changing environments challenges or demands it involves the ability to

00:10:54	adjust Behavior beliefs or strategies based on new information or experience leading to improved performance and outcomes okay adaptation feedback and reinforcement learning is often facilitated by feedback and reinfor I think the feedback and reinforcement is more like either either a class test where where the teacher keeps a test and then says okay the these are all correct these are wrong and um the expectation is okay these are wrong so I should correct them that's expectation but people have forgot that that's the

00:11:27	intention of exams more on they struck with okay this is my score okay that is my potential that is my capabilities is what they'll think but I believe it's it's more the other way saying the exams are to see what you know what you don't know what you have covered what you don't cover what you understood what you have not understood so that you can focus on what you have not understood and then people should start learning towards it matter of fact um an exam should actually extend the classes and and add more specific educations or

00:12:11	learnings for individuals that's that's how I I think I think the mod systems are going towards the direction excuse me feedback and reinforcement um um is nice it willfor strength learning correct feedback helps individuals correct correct err and improve performance it could also be a task right you and then somebody tells you oh no no you're like you're putting that part of the thing first instead of uh in of using this part so that is that will not make the complete setup right so they'll guide you and then you learn from it

00:12:51	okay I'm not supposed to keep this part and and you do things right right yeah so feedback and so it it it boils on to acquisition of information Concepts and skills retention understanding adaptation because you understand it doesn't make you good about it until unless you adapt it um when you say when you say adopting is um there are challenges during the understanding process and stuff you should overcome the challenge for example there is something in machine learning where you don't understand like a math or

00:13:33	something like that so you should adopt it you should learn it so somebody comes in and says I want to learn machine learning and then he starts off and says he has a hurdle that is there is some mathematical equation which he can't understand so you can't say oh no I'm I'm here to learn machine learning so I can't learn math so that is something which is not possible so people should cross adopt to whatever is required their focus should be on on machine learning that they want to learn kind of

00:14:00	stuff whatever comes in a way they should pass that hles they should adopt to it and then pass through it or they they'll not have fulfilled and kind of stuff and obviously final one is sorry guys feedback and reinforcement okay let's move on to the next thing how can a machine learn it's not learning how can a machine yesterday also sorry guys somewhere why do we need to why need to understanding of a okay I'll write it here quickly learning is acquiring understanding um adapting I missed done

00:15:05	something with feedback sorry feedback I think I missed on something on retention oh see I'm not retaining tension understanding adapting of information skills what's other word here use Concepts B up okay how can I machine learn yeah maybe I can add a little bit here on uh when we say machine learn it's actually when people think of machine learning I would actually think it is not about a machine learning on its own or something like that it's actually most of the invent ions in the machine space or computer

00:16:35	space kind of stuff I strongly believe I tell people that it is nothing but you're trying to mimic humans Behavior because I think um whatever is human doing so human um behavior is replicated are mimicked on a machine so that the machine can do it on on its own so that we we did not do the work it's a like it's like escaping the work that we are supposed to do and we getting it done by machines kind of stuff so machine learning is very close are we're trying to mimic how the humans would learn things and um

00:17:21	like how humans would acquire knowledge how they retain it how they understand it how they adopt to it it and how they take feedback and reinforcement to improve on top of it so the same thing is a humans doing it they're they're making machines do it so that um machines can behave like humans that's their old so I I this is a very important concept okay so um when I say concept it is not about um the this is a this is the way of thinking right way of thinking we think machine learning or deep learning or Ai

00:18:07	and all those concepts are are complex new or vast but what I'm trying to tell you is machine learning AI deep learning any any topic that you get into is actually very close to what is there inside so whatever machine learning does you already are doing it whatever deep learning does you're already doing it whatever AA is trying to achieve you're already doing it and the good part is they're still at a very small percentage of what you can do so your intelligence is always is is not I can't use the word

00:18:48	always but is still dominant than a machine learning so and it is all inside you all you need to do is read all this content and then realize saying okay okay that's what I do in order to learn in order to understand in order to adapt and stuff so same thing is what we are trying to do it by Machine uh but the difference is this is important that's the reason I'm speaking more on on about it we do it naturally so as today as we were saying natural intelligence right we do it naturally we don't say okay this is

00:19:25	information put it to this format store it here and uh if this is my understanding of information are um these are all the dependencies that are there in the data and uh you should connect this data in this in this way when a situation comes or a problem comes when you're trying to solve it you don't um you don't specifically go and say okay retrieve this information you bring this data you tie them together see BAS basing on this information how things are going we don't deal with all that right so that actually happens

00:20:04	naturally we don't um we still don't know if you if you know that's a I think that will be a if you know to the detail I would say I wouldn't say we don't know because we do know to some extent um but um if we know it completely then the advance that we'll have in the AI field or replication of that will be will be a one jint hop will take us to the next level so I hope that doesn't happen because you you you start creating a replicas of of Raja and then it will be very boring to see somebody who's as

00:20:47	smart as intelligent as as me or somebody else right so okay let's come come back to how can a machine learn so I'll I'll to to make it faster I'll I'll just um go through what he means in in a in shorter term so one is data collection so machine can learn through a process these are the steps it says first step is to learn it's to gather relevant data and then from the the machine needs to extract uh features which will actually give some meaning to the data that's if data comes in either in form of a text audio or

00:21:35	something like that if you look at it it is more it's it's more a binary kind of stuff right it doesn't actually have um any meaning to it how do you add meaning to it is to understand what the data really means like what features are there what kind of data information that is it is there in the data kind of stuff right so then once once you understand what is there inside the data as features feature extraction then you actually do a training of the data so training of the data is nothing but it says okay this is the

00:22:13	data these are the features and uh within the features and data uh let's use let's be practical saying um you you wouldn't get the whole data right so if you have if there is if there is some data which is extensive that means there is no more new data that to be created like uh a list of um images of a duck and if you have like this is super set of duck images you cannot have any more kind of ducks which is practically not possible but let's say if it is then there is there is nothing to be um there's

00:23:00	nothing to bring intelligence onto top Intelligence on top of um it it's it's all about looking at all these images and it will ask you it will pick up one of the image in this there is no new image that is coming from outside and last good is Du all you need to do is okay do I have this image in my database okay this is where it is so it's just search and then retrieve and say okay this is there in my data set so it's in it's a duck so you see it's more learning and retrieval information that's it we we are not bringing in

00:23:33	intelligence factor into it where um where we are not talking about an unknown thing but so machine learning is not targeted for to for not just about retrieving information about known things but machine learning adopts the concept of intelligence from solving a problem or answering a question which is unknown as well so to do that we within the data that we have to simulate that behavior what we do is we segregate the data into training data and a test data where the test data becomes our unknown data you don't know

00:24:18	that so you're not trained on it so out of this extensive list of ducks if there are any what we do we we take a certain set and the remaining set we we say we don't know so what we do the learning is always focused on this data that we know and um our intelligence our application of our learning will actually be focused on the unknown the more you learn about the known data and you're the more you are able to predict about the unknown data is where is where the whole intelligence comes into picture but the learning process that we

00:24:55	talking about or discussing today is focus on this data so the training data is where the learning comes from okay so the training data is is that and the training data also talks of both pieces where it talks about um what is this data and it also brings in if you guys remember about uh intelligence it's it's about um we were also talking about analyzing and um analyzing information of what you can infer from that particular data right so here you you understand what what is the data what are the features how are those features

00:25:37	ranging what kind of data is inside the each feature and all that you understand and you also infer something about it so it could be saying okay B if if if the feature one feature two feature three feature 4 or so on if they are in this format this could be this what I can infer basing on that features so you also see what you can infer out of it it's not just about raw data you can you'll also start building okay if this is how feature one feature two feature three is and rest of the features are

00:26:13	like this then this is what I'll infer out of it and um like maybe to take an example of a duck and an image um if it it has two legs if it has wings um and if it if it is if its neck is curled like this these are all features right so if the features are like that then you you actually infer so again when I say infer it's not about okay this is the just you you make it dark no it could not be it could be uh you achieve it in a smaller pieces like okay so this is you you for basing on these features this is I this is

00:26:55	these are wings these are legs this is mouth like that you in for small pieces and then you build another layer on top of it where you say okay so if this is how the eyes are if this is how the neck is if this is how the wings are and um so it it could be a part of a bird that's that's again another level of infer infering and and um it need not be a single direction of inference it could be multiple direction of inference okay this could be a wing uh this could be a tail to some extent because you're not clear let's say

00:27:32	you're looking at a smaller piece of the whole Wing you're still not sure what part of it is so another layer comes in basing on the inference that you bought from the actual data so what you do is you stitch together these inferences in multiple layers and then overall you actually see oh okay so it has it has small legs it has wings and it has a curved neck and stuff so it could be duck is where you'll end up with right so um so the the training data might not actually have all layers it could also have all layers that's

00:28:17	also possible or it could have actually it could have actually the initial data that is there and the top layer the individual layers in between is is what your understanding of the information is and um but your expectation or the data that is given to us training data might have only some layers of it are the end layer of it right okay this is an image and that is a duck this is an image and that is a mouse so it it the training data could have some level of analysis or it could actually say another way this is

00:28:55	an image and this has an ie okay some ey it didn't say which eye is it a duck eye is it a mouse eye is it a human ey it doesn't it didn't say so the inference the inference when I say inference understanding that you get out of the data that is provided to you it could be multiple that's also part of training data that's an important thing now next concept of learning uh um he he gets I think he he's getting into detail on um machine learning so but I think we've covered already the question saying uh

00:29:39	how can a machine learn so that question I think it is um all answer but I'll brief it here again a start solving the problems so that's what I talked about so I'm not repeating uh this typing thing doesn't look good and then I think I I can also hear that you guys are hearing a lot of sound but I think it's it's good to note it down so that people will also remember what they are trying to learn so next moving on to the next question what all inputs does it need so what all inputs does it need um

00:31:22	I think we covered it just now in detail about the training data is part of it um so machines need access to information in different formats they might need uh some specification on the data the name features available also the also need um [Music] what we are trying to derive out of this information information so so we feed in machine no information and we expect it to handle the unknown information and for some solution out of it so to that's what we already spoke about um I'm trying to see what all inputs does it

00:33:56	need we give it data so again the data information is is the key thing that we uh give it to machine but we should make sure the data information is is in an understandable format so like what does a machine understand um let's say it understands text um and and you can actually you can as it's a machine it depends on the the hardware capabilities and stuff on what it can understand right like a machine which has a webcam can look at things and understand so it has actually a capability of looking at things and understanding so

00:34:41	you can actually provide it visual information um something like a cc cameras that you have on on the streets where the CC cameras can look at things and it can take the information it can learn on top of it kind of stuff but but um some machines might be they can only hear voice like a mic right it can hear to the voice and and it will store that information it'll decode it it'll understand like um like I say hey Siri and um the the Siri pops up and then so and it's it starts um asking us what

00:35:20	do you want and all stuff right so so the inputs can be taken multiple ways but uh the machine can be configured to to say what kind of inputs can it what kind of capability does the machine have from the hardware and software perspective and what kind of data it can understand few can understand images you can understand audio few can understand text if you basing on maybe if you if you provide enough software it can understand different formats of text in different formats of language or something like that

00:35:56	so yeah so that's about what inut do it so what do see this process what do we see as intelligence in this process um that's a good question to ask so what do we see as intelligence in this process I'll of machine learning the process of machine learning intelligence is exped through the ability of algorithms to analyze data identify patterns make predictions and adopt their behavior based on experience without being explicitly programmed to do so manifest yeah that's a good point actually so as I as I gave you an example if if I

00:36:52	give give saying extensive list of data and then just picking up something like that it's programmatically being done all you do is an is an image comparison where you say this this is your Source image this is your your target image as long as you make sure that both of the images are um stored in in a similar format um as you know the images can be stored in different formats kind of stuff right as long as they're stored in similar format all you need to do is it's it's it's again is what you see but

00:37:28	underlying it it will be stored in some format some format of data right in memory you store it using some kind of either binary or or some kind of could be multiple layers right if can use different encodings and all you can store in certain formats again it's information that's all right so again your target if it's also information then what you do this if these two are information that is there you need to compare both of them and this doesn't necessarily need um Intelligence on top of it but um so you

00:38:10	you can explicitly program for it on how to you how do you compare these IM and a right image how do you uh look through a database how do you pass a text and extract information because you know what is the pattern in which the data is you know what is the how to compare images and extract what is relevant information is and all that stuff but how do you deal with something where you don't know what is the pattern you don't know what to pass you don't know what is the extensive set of things from which you can actually find

00:38:47	where if you don't find it you can actually say unknown I don't know right uh but what if you don't have that knowledge our information is extensive uh then what would you do that is where the intelligence um picks in so what you do is with the given data you don't look at it like okay if F1 F2 F3 is a feature this is what I'll infer you don't stop there but you actually try to create a pattern on basing of the the the million of records that you have for all those features try to see okay it's not about

00:39:32	one row of data or two row of three row of data basing on all of the data how does feature one influence my inference how does feature two influence my inference feature three influence my particular inference like um like how does my feature one says whether it is Duck or not feature two says whether it is Duck or not feature three says or not how does a combination of feature and one and feature two say duck or not or is it like um how is there another way of correlation between it may not be a direct relation

00:40:07	saying feature one if it is X it has certain value then it will become duck right so feature one could have more influence on deck if because if it is if if it has a neck which is curved uh which is not usually in majority of the things that we look at that's that actually triggers our brain normally okay okay this kind of looks like a duck that's that's our first thing right looking at similar behavior of what humans does we want the machines also to adopt to it basing on the information that we have because if you

00:40:48	look deep into it how did you come to that conclusion on identifying a duck is is is nothing but when you have seen lot of duck it's either in physical world and somebody has told you see this is funny and I think we are going a little lengthier but it's it's a good good thing what if I take you you've never seen a duck and um there is some small black bird um that we that you see around here let's say and I I start telling you that this is duck that one is is also duck if I show you and after a while I actually I show

00:41:32	you a real duck that other people call it as duck would you recognize it you don't recognize it right so why is that the human brain also works in a similar fashion where you see a pattern okay this is duck what he said okay this is also duck okay what is the similarity in between both of them what is kind of a pattern I see to in between both of them and also he would have shown a hand he would have shown as Sparrow and then I can also visually my human brain can understand a pattern on what is the

00:42:03	differences also it's not only about understanding one single data but it also understands what it is not as well right so it's not only about understanding what is duck you should also understand what is not a duck so what happens this guy when he showed me Ducks he has shown me everything black that's the pattern I recognized saying somebody brings in a duck and if it's not in black color that wouldn't strike saying that will not filter saying okay these are the possibilities of what it could be and and duck is also a

00:42:34	possibility will go away because it doesn't put in the pattern so um what do we do as intelligence in process machine learning is this very very important thing is the pattern recognization so that's how human brain also works I think um I'm clear if I'm not um maybe you can give it a thought on on you can ask this question to yourself saying okay I look at things and how do I quickly infer saying this is this and not that and uh look think of a situation like um somebody who has good knowledge on plans right

00:43:10	they'll um I think that's very complex thing for me look at plans I mean I can't do it maybe I should learn about it or something like that but you classify it right saying this plant is a flower plant it's a vegetable plant or something like that right so how do you do it because all the plants are green all the plants might have similar Heights not all but Ma of the plants in that kind have similar height so what you do is you have certain patterns that you recognize which for example I don't recognize

00:43:41	because I don't have that learning and intelligence somebody would have that learning and intelligence somebody would have been exposed to that information and stuff they would have uh Tred to classify that particular plant as something in the past and somebody who would have guided them or are an online tool would have told them no you're wrong uh this is how it is and uh these are the features that you should look at and then and then it starts learning okay maybe I should look at how the leaf is how the lines are on

00:44:10	the leaf and that pattern and recognize and I can actually say okay if this is the color this is how the leaves are this is how the lines on the leaves are this is how the stems are and all the stuff those are all different patterns that I extract out of it and then basing on that I say okay this is could be this plan okay so that's how you recognize pattern I spent a lot of time explaining about this pattern recognition because everything in machine learning boils down to this pattern recognization and that is how the human

00:44:42	brain is doing pattern recognization and we are trying to give that capability to a machine that's where the whole machine learning intelligence and everything is coming into picture coming to the next thing is adaptable team so again so I look at some as as I said previous example somebody has shown me a black bird and then he showed me told me it's a duck but what happens is that black bird could be sitting at the point of time the black bird might be in water the black bird might be in different

00:45:16	situations right so we should be able to adopt to infer the information even though there are the information is huge right so we should but we should be able to adopt changes in the environment and input data irrespective of the the other things that are there we should be able to say okay this is what I want to focus on right so people should be able to adapt and people should also start adding in more features it's not like once I look at certain ducks and then I have certain pattern patterns and then I say this is

00:45:57	what is duck it it doesn't um mean that tomorrow I'm not going to learn something new about duck right so as I said I'll classify saying basing on the previous knowledge I'll say anything black is Duck Right but um I I would do a mistake right that there'll be a crow and I I would classif as duck then somebody will come and say no if if the if the m is this it is in this way it's pointing it's not a duck it is actually a crow so that will be another pattern that okay if it is black and the crow the rank is

00:46:38	like this then that is then duck and if it is not it is not duck and and if I start learning more about Crow then I'll say if it is like this then it could be a crow so these are the different patterns will adapt over the period of time so the patterns are not fixed the patterns could go and and you should adopt to it so as I said generalization so um I can't actually say I can't look at two or three um dogs uh ducks or maybe apples or number plates or anything and say and say this is what it could be it's EXT

00:47:19	extensive is is is okay you can say it but what happens if you see another duck what happens if you see another dog what happens if you look at another number plate number plate so you'll say I don't know what it is right because you see another one and it's not exactly same like this so so that's where generalization comes into picture where you generalize your experience you don't you don't say this is exactly like feature one is equal to something feature 2 is equal something and feature 10 is equal to

00:47:53	something then only it becomes that you don't specialize or or have a specific pattern saying this is how it is going to be could be also there there could be use cases it could be but you don't do it that way so that you accommodate are you also consciously know you don't know you're not knowing everything and that has been that's your that's your learning and that has been told to you saying you are being given part of the knowledge not the complete set of this concept is also very important because the more you

00:48:28	think that you know everything the less you can actually look for are able to interpret the unknown okay so you should always learn the known um but you should not say you should not adopt to the known so much the features of the known so much so that you think that is all it is because if you don't generalize generalizing is nothing but you don't draw a boundary and say okay this is only are the ones which are ducks if you if you General if you don't generalizing is where you can say this are ducks there could also

00:49:19	be another thing which is closed to a duck it need not exact 100% be but the patterns that I recognize that's the reason a machine learning or anything like that it never tells you you give it an image it will never tell you like most probably it most of Alm they never tell you this is yeah this is 100% duck until unless it is exactly known even if it's exactly known it will still doesn't say 100% duck so it would say if its response is like 80% I'm sure or 90% I'm sure it's a duck because the learning is not generalized

00:50:01	and it it knows that it needs to have that unknown Gap there a little bit so that it it actually accommodates new things new it still has the capability of of learning new patterns so that's where the generalization concept comes from learning from feedback um so in is where it's it's it's it's not rigid the amount of patterns and all the stuff that you have you would have recognized a pattern and the pattern could be wrong so you should change it you could have listed list of patterns and thought you would have thought like

00:50:47	okay these are extensive if these patterns are matching I'm good but you might discover another pattern so you should adopt to it and um you should how do you know know this your pattern is wrong or how do you know that you have missed the pattern and all that that's all from feedback right see um you would have classified something as duck and then somebody comes back and tells you um dude how grow up how do you know why are you calling it a duck you can clearly say it has it has eyes or his tail is different so how can you say

00:51:22	then okay then what I would think of is okay I've been thinking that if a bird has a tail like this then it would be a duck but uh if the tail is like that then I should I should say I and now I know saying it is not a duck so I add add that pattern and the existing pattern that say say anything with this form of a tail is a duck that will also be tweak saying no not anything but if only these is is a duck but if it is of this kind of a variant of of a tail then it is not a duck so I I'll learn from

00:52:01	feedback and add to it autonomy so yeah machine learning and intelligence machine intelligence comes into picture where you are trying to create a human who humanlike Behavior so humans are taught humans are provided with information uh humans are given feedback and stuff but humans are not always accompanied by person who has that knowledge and capability right there would be experts in fields they come they'll they'll give a talk or they'll speak about something and um and we would adopt to it but you

00:52:46	can't carry that expert all the way all the time with you right so but machines also same thing right you you tell the machine this is what is the data these are the patterns this is what you need to infer and all that stuff once you tell it how to gather the information how to understand the information how to adapt it and how to recognize the patterns and how to identify the patterns and how to infer the analysis or solve a problem you should it should be it should be doing things on its own without dependent on an expert or a

00:53:21	human to interfere and give it things that's also one of the intelligence factors that we should think of so it also says complex problem solving but that's a different story with respect to intelligence okay that is how the intelligence is oh today we didn't go here I would actually say this will keep it as day three I'll quickly note this down pattern recognization adaptability generalization learning adaptation generalization um to to take feedback and learning from feedback autonomy aomy so are the kind

00:54:39	of behaviors adopted by Machine similar to humans is where we call it intelligent and these are achieved partially through machine learning process so day three we'll move on day one is supposed to be basics of machine learning um I think Basics has become very basic of machine learning but I feel this is worthy to spend this much of time here um it really makes sense um and um this is gives very foundationally good understanding it would have been lengthy but um again I said these are baby steps and and this is the way to go

00:55:48	you should have this this level of understanding this is the thought process that you need to adopt once you adopt this thought process that is where you you understand the concepts much more complex Concepts in in much better way this level of foundational thinking where you you go to Grassroots and then understand things and then you you put one layer on top of it the complex things when they come in the complexity is already removed because you your foundations are that strong that this complexity you already have this covered

00:56:23	all you need to do is understand this piece and you're good with it but people struggle to understand the whole complex thing because they don't have a stronger foundational knowledge so this is where you you learn the foundational knowledge is what I what I believe okay thanks everyone that's it for today let's connect tomorrow and um let's discuss about um about few of the machine learning models stop sharing bye-bye see
