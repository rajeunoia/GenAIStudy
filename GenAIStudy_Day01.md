0:4:31 -  hey uh hi everyone so today we will focus on uh um the study plan from today um I'll see if I can share my screen uh window Chrome D window and Screen yeah screen is better so this is more um planning session today on um what we going to do and stuff so what's the focus so or what is the target so clear the target is to gain good knowledge artificial intelligence so start our journey towards exper field so so we'll put it broadly like that not sure I'm audible because I'm speaking very low which is okay for day one we'll improve it as we start off within Ain the next few days okay so today we'll start off with learning on what is artificial intelligence so why do we need toand Ai and have plan on how we are going to set up this Journey so we'll try to cover this three things um in today's plan um Al focus on how I am going to do it I'll be using S GPT to learn things and also online views as required Maybe YouTube videos our deep learning a are blogs the [Music] relevant

0:7:4 -  information information sounds good okay let's get started so for what is artificial intelligence so I assume I I know this better I can speak of I can speak of artificial intelligence but again I strongly believe uh um for any subject quickly people have their own perception of what it means what it understands but U and I always to used to believe that as long as you are clear on what it is and and understand it you're good um but um my experience also says that it's it's not about your understanding alone because you you always either do things for someone are you work with someone are you build things that someone will use so whatever your understanding is you should be able to communicate it you should be able to be on the same page with other people and stuff or else you having your own understanding and perception of things might not really um work for for a team for for targeted people to build a product or something like that so keeping that in mind artificial intelligence I will go with my version of understanding AR but also we look online maybe ask GPT what is explain it like it is expanding to a kid um we'll try out things like that but okay my um goal understanding of artificial intelligence is um uh intelligence itself um goes in a way that people can um uh look at things understand things process what it means or what is happening and um analyze what is happening and respond to it with relevant either relevant information relevant action anything like that so um that that that sounds very basic but um

0:9:43 -  in in what I said um every step how to look at things how to understand things how to analyze it and how to respond to it itself um carries um lot of uh um lot of variables like uh how to look at things um how to understand it and uh how to analyze it and how to respond to it right those answers are very very uh critical so [Music] um how to look at things is um is your viewpoint of of how things are happening so um when I say look at things it's not physically having eyes and looking at things and stuff what all data or information that you can gather related to that topic for example if you are um thinking about um um how doctors should responds respond in an emergency situation [Music] then you need to gather relevant information for it for example um what is uh Emergency Response Team what do they do who all are required so there are a lot of information around the topic and we should actually um that is my my view of starting off with how an Emergency Response Unit should be considered as uh a hospitals team right so that's the way I'm looking at those things but people have a different way of looking at things so intelligence starts from here because your experience tells you what to look for so basing on your experience and what you look for people could start from very basic people basing on that experience they they go specific on what to look for and that makes a lot of difference because um um you it's it's a journey right it's it's not like okay this is the right thing to do no there there are multiple

0:12:15 -  ways of reaching it right so your experience takes it much closer right so you don't you don't start off with saying what is emergency response team right because you already know what emergency response team is maybe you would have seen it somewhere maybe you would have heard it somewhere maybe you experienced it somewhere basing on the experience you much you get much closer so that's um experience is the word that I use is is nothing but um in a way it is a knowledge so your knowledge says what to look for so looking also has a concept of intelligence um and then understanding second topic um when when you know something and then you start digging into it and find out more details about it you understand it again so to understand it also you need intelligence our understanding is also part of intelligence as per my knowledge um so it's like um uh you have a you have some video or or audio or text that is in front of you and um so basing on what you know for example language like it's written in English so you know English so you can read it um you know the grammar of of of the subject and stuff so you can understand what is what is being written there so you understand the meaning of those words and and stuff second secondly basing on your previous knowledge levels of the specific topic maybe it is about um um it's about some gardening about some plants and stuff so basing on your previous knowledge of gardening for example somebody like me who's not much into gardening and stuff not don't know uh the different process that they do how do they put soil what kind of soils are there and all that stuff if I don't know my understanding of the topic is very low so I need to pick up a lot of things to understand understand it better so my what I look for will be different and then my understanding of it the starting point will be different but I as I need to I as I look for more things my understanding will start growing as my understanding grows so my analysis of this specific thing that I'm

0:14:48 -  looking at will also vary and because what you do is look understand analyze when you say analyze you might be looking at a huge amount of data you might be looking at a huge amount of content but you to start off you you you might not understand everything uh you will be understanding something specific again as I said it depends on your previous knowledge it may not necessarily beated topics but it could be related to that particular context your your particular understanding of the language your particular understanding of your are your your occupation the way you have grown your place where you live basing on that your understanding will be different and basing on that understanding you can you'll do your own analysis and basing on your analysis that you do here you will actually have some kind of a learning that you actually keep in your mind and basing and that's actually I mean like to be more specific on analysis you would have seen a content of 10 hours of YouTube video you would have read content on blogs for for maybe four or five blogs something like that but um you I'm sure you're not going to remember all of that I mean maybe subconsciously everybody remembers everything that's what I believe only thing is we don't know how to retrieve it but um even if you do you always store a summary of it and U and even though you you can't remember the 1 hour 10 hour video in detail the summary is what you will carry and you you'll have it at a at a higher level of your memory and you can D it faster so the anal analysis phase is is that forming that layer on top of the ground knowledge of 10 hour videos and multiple blogs and stuff which actually says these are the key points these are the important points and these are the pointers of the um of this whole topic that you need to remember that you need to focus on again these topics that you remember these these points that you focus on and stuff that purely depends on um um but that purely depends on your

0:17:18 -  understanding your perception of the particular topic and stuff so it would be different for different people their analysis is completely different for different people now coming to the fourth stage you talking about responding so when we come to responding um so you have looked at something you understood it you analyzed it and because of these first three steps what happened is you framed certain knowledge you framed certain analysis of of of your own of that particular subject now you respond to things for example as you said about gardening you looked up on how to do gardening what are the benefits of gardening what kind of um what kind of material do you need for gardening what kind of equipment do you need for gardening and what is a plan for gardening so you you look up and what are the different plans how do you grow them what kind of climate conditions there lot of topics that you you then understand all these topics and how they what they work and then you analyze and have some saying okay this is what the gardening is going to be this is how it this there are different plans for different plans this is what we do and different situations is how you respond that's all your analysis that that layer comes on it then now the responding layer comes because on top of all this information knowledge analysis that you have saying somebody comes and say okay this is the winter and um I want to uh grow a specific plant um uh but I I I don't have much of water supply so the responding Point goes where it is a specific scenario specific use case and there you start basing on your um information that you looked at your understanding your analysis whatever you have basing on that you respond to that the topic you might not have looked at the relevant information specific to the question you might not have the understanding that is required covering this particular topic and also you might not have analyzed on required details of the topic but basing on the topic that that is in place you would respond to it basing on the knowledge understanding and Analysis that you have already done previously you respond to this particular

0:20:46 -  question is that a right answer are you hallucinating something um will it solve the specific problem we don't know so what we do when you do this response to this thing you try to get a feedback to see or you try to look at things to understand whether did my response work out are there any gaps there and stuff like let's say some somebody says no you said you can actually um do an outdoor planting to achieve specific plans in this much duration this much weather but you missed out on a point saying if there is more moisture outside these plants survival rate is little low so considering that can we have an alternative to keep them indoor so something like that could be a missing point because maybe You' not looked at that particular content maybe you not or you would not have understood that content or maybe you didn't analyze the content to that level of detail so that you can actually cover consider that also as one of the metrics when you do your whole analysis and when you do respond to a specific specific use case so that's my take on artificial sorry that's my take on intelligence um and now coming back on the artificial intelligence whatever I I spoke to you you it would have sounded pretty natural for us right like um maybe you don't classify it call it and and and think through things like that you um you do it in a natural process right so for [Music] so this is intelligence and um following this without depending on um so natural intelligence as for me is again following the steps of intelligence by AR without uh depending

0:24:44 -  on tools people intelligence is um [Music] so brain [Music] [Applause] [Music] where is yeah is where the the intelligence both steps can be achieved using exal tools our Hardware has [Music] webcams [Music] iot sensors [Music] um [Music] microphone speakers and many more so these Hardware they come together and try to mimic whatever we do it tries to mimic what we do as part of natural intelligence and try to duplicate our process of looking understanding analyzing and responding to different use cases so that's my meaning that's my understanding of what is artificial intelligence but let me also ask um LGBT um onward things what is um okay what is it okay in can be understood in are SP depending on the context but generally it refers to the ability to acquire and apply Knowledge and Skills effectively intelligence involves reasoning problem solving abstract thinking learning understanding and adapting to new situations it's not just about knowing facts but also about how well one can use that knowledge to navigate and succeed in different environments intelligence can manifest in different forms such as logical mathematical intelligence

0:28:2 -  linguistic intelligence spatial intelligence interpersonal intelligence intrapersonal intelligence Etc as proposed by or G the of multiple intelligence let's ask it the next question what [Music] is the innate cognitive abilities that humans and other organisms process without external Dimension it compounds the mental capacities and skills that individuals are born with all through natural process such as genetic inheritance maturation and environmental interactions includes various aspects such as problem solving skills memory capacity language acquisition spatial awareness social cognition Ando understanding this term is often contrasted with which refers to the simulation of human and machines created by humans this is characterized by its adaptability creativity and emotionals to replicate cognitive functions [Music] and is developed through a combination of genetic factors and noral and individual experiences here's how it typically unfolds So reading of it will take time so but skim through it so genetic inheritance so when humans inherit certain cognitive abilities and predispositions from their parents through genes early brain development brain under significant development during infancy and early childhood neural connections are formed defined and strengthened through experiences interactions and stimulations environmental stimulations such as access to education nutrition Social Development economic status family environment and stuff learning and experience human learn acire new skills through experience practice and exposure to D stimuli and learning activities and expand their cognitive abilities shape and refine social interactions play crucial role in the development of emotional intelligence empathy communication skills and social okay we'll move on to the final question what is to [Music] sim a systems are designed to analyze data adapt to new inputs and make decisions

0:31:29 -  based on the information they receive nice a comp a broad range of techniques and Technologies including machine learning deep learning natural language processing computer vision robotics expert systems sounds good overall a technolog are revolutionizing that's okay it's a sumary this looks definitely interesting so let's look at it this is this is I think is something new or okay let's see it is um original design Ares naturally through biological evolution and development it is result of complex interactions between genetic factors and en learning experiences and social interactions is intial designed and created by humans it involves developing algorithms models and systems that stimulate aspects of human intelligence using computers and programming languages learning adaptation natural intelligence humans process innate learning capabilities and cognitive flexibilities allowing them to adopt new situations learn from experiences and acquire knowledge over time AI systems learn from data through techniques such as machine learning and de learning while AI can be trained to perform specific tasks and make decisions based on patterns and it lacks the broader adaptability and generalization capabilities of human emotional social in that's a lang human emotional intelligence cogn and inter understand navigate complex social dynamics and relationship lacks emotional intelligence and social understanding while AI systems can process and analyze textual or visual data related to emotions or social they do not experience emotions or process empathy in the same way wants to creativity and Innovation asence create Innovation and original thinking hum [Music] algorithms and computational techs rather than genuine physical capabilities this is where to large extent they are varying right now and eventually it's going to bre the Gap is closely integrated with the bodies sensory motor capable is all individuals to perceive and interact

0:36:47 -  with the physical world through senses such as sight hearing touch and proprioception which is a new word I don't know this word so looks look up Inception perception or awareness of the position and movement of the body oh okay the I operates primly in the digital realm processing and analyzing data in the form of test text images audio and sensor inputs where AI power drops and autonomous systems can perform physically Tas the lack of sensory richness and embod cognition of human intelligence then performs [Music] see [Music] super intelligent AI okay this is the future guys artificial general intelligence Advan reasoning [Music] PR space exp Health long yeah and sustainability and culture okay thank you so [Music] wrong for some reason the book is not coming [Music] up as okay I think I should pause the video it's recording from here stop sharing okay so guys because of okay it's it's now working there's some challenge um I'm going to present again under screen for this okay so we covered on what is why do we need understand ofi I think we covered how a is relevant to Natural intelligence answers question understanding of AI and also the question on how I will evolve next in

0:43:46 -  future speaks a lot on [Music] I Learning Journey okay um so we will study around um 45 minutes to start off today and try to increase it to one hour um Target is be to have continuation learning and um without a plan on all the topics that we will [Music] cover so that we are going towards our Target so um bold this will be the emphasis now um we should actually have um list of topics that we're going to cover but at least a plan for tomorrow if we're going to cover and stuff that should be that should be there here like [Music] [Music] so let's ask um AI can [Music] foree [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] I [Music] [Music] Happ okay basics of machine learning okay sounds good some issue with sharing [Music] so so day two day one is inro to AI day two is basics of machine
