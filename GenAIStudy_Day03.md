0:3:17 -  hey hi hi everyone so we'll um get started this is day three and uh today we are going to discuss about basics of machine learning algorithms yesterday uh day one we have covered introduction to artificial intelligence day two we have covered um basics of machine learning but we have understood more on what is machine learning and what is the essence or or what is the requirement of uh bringing in something called machine learning um and today we'll look at machine learning algorithms um I'll also see if we can actually um generate some code using chat GPT for um for few of the algorithms and try to run it so that we get little um handson but the time is little limited so let's see what all we can do um so I'll uh be talking about um types of machine learning and then um we'll pick up we last so today it's more chat GPT we we'll drive it through chat GPT to see what are the uh different types and then what in in each of the types what the different algorithms and um briefly we'll ask about each algorithm and then we'll read through what it um means and stuff and if there is time we'll try to run on of the algorithm we'll just ask it for code and then I think I think we can run one of the algorithm with the with the base code uh um so that's it let's go so let's see if my document is still open it is present screen [Music] so what are different okay and run [Music] it okay good [Music] so I can ask GPD this question okay let's ask so it will be majorly it will be supervised ma [Music] learning supervised learning and uh so the segregation goes um like this it it depends on um the the machine learning always depends on how it is

0:5:48 -  being it's agre different types basing on how it is being taught and how it is learning and all that stuff so there are use cases where um the uh data that we have right we what we give to machine learning is prime machine learning what we give give it as input is data and what it has like like the machine learning is called what it has is algorithm which is nothing but a model and um what it gives output is the inference so the input what we provide for training and uh the for and create an algorithm that algorithm basing on this input will become model with so-called intelligence um and stuff and um later on when we give some certain input um we get output so um then we pick the first piece that is the data that we want to give to the algorithm and and train it to make to convert it into a model roid so this input data we can actually put it classify into two types of what what is possible right so um it's certain data we have uh information um people observe that okay we can provide certain data where I can actually have uh the the in information um which can also be classified as um um what is the output of it we know already what is the output of it for some of the information we might not have extensive list of everything for example like the example that we discussing yesterday that is we have set of images of ducks and we also know that they are ducks right so that is um where you know you have certain images and you also know what does what does this um images mean right so when you have data like that which can be given to the algorithm which can be converted model and stuff so that it can predict an unknown image later point of time then that is called supervised learning that is you have supervised machine learning is nothing but the whole machine learning machine learning works on basing on training on certain data and that data is actually is already having we know already what the

0:8:22 -  data is and what does it infer okay like set of images and they and they are ducks or you have set of images which says these are which classifies these are different plans uh like that we have the input data and also we have the output response but for certain not extens said if it is extensive if you have all possible plants pictures and then their names um on the whole universe something like that then you are like you don't need machine learning there it's actually a um it's it's a normal application right it's a normal program which can actually um Pro which can actually compare the images when you take an image compare the image efficiently and then and then give us um but whereas in machine learning it's it's as as we discussed yesterday it's more about taking an unknown um input which exactly might not be there previously um but still we should be able to give predict an output with sorry with a certain probability right so you you you give an image of some animal and it would predict saying it is Duck or not a duck with certain certain probability basing on the previous experience of looking at that's exactly what Humans Do Right humans identify things that something is a door something a fan something is balloon or whatever basing on um their experience of previously looking at uh those things and somebody would have told or they would have read or something saying okay this is called a fan this is called a balloon this is called a door this is called a window and all this right so that's how um uh that's how super superise machine learning would work coming to unsupervised machine learning as the as the word says um unsupervised is where uh we have input data uh but the input data doesn't actually have this actual inference so that means you have the set of images given to you but uh it does is is not they call called labeling it's not labeled on what image is what like you have you have of all

0:11:4 -  fruits but um they are not labeled saying okay these are app these are oranges these are peers these are strawberry this is grapes or whatever it is it is it is not labeled as what imagees what so it's like people don't have the data the data is generated somewhere where um where like maybe they they were randomly going through some uh food store and they were actually taking pictures of everything but what they forgot is when they're taking pictures they forgot to or after when they store those images in some memory they not they have not um but given it a name proper naming they were actually calling it everything fruit fruit one fruit one fruit fruit kind of stuff so everything is fruit uh so you don't know what fruit is what so that is somewhere you have data uh but you don't know what the data means and um but you still want the machine to learn about that uh data so uh so what Happ is um learning about the data when we say learning about the data the machine can as I said it's it's about intelligence is about looking at the data understanding the data and uh and analyzing the data and then getting an ability to excuse getting an ability to predict that's what intelligence is is right so machine can um uh look at those unclassified text or images or speech or whatever it can try to understand them when I say understand um it if it is uh if it doesn't know what it means it will actually understand basing on the um it it it itself actually um understands what's the behavior of it for example if you give it a text it will say okay what kind of words are there inside it okay uh what length of words how they are arranged there are different things that you can actually um understand for example um let's say you you look at a specific um um device and uh you don't even know what it is called and you don't know how to uh open it or use it kind of stuff so then what you do you call your friend right and you you can't see what the device is um

0:13:35 -  so you you call your friend and then you explain right saying okay this is something [Music] um which has uh uh which has four legs and uh it has a top I don't know um and um there are screws with it it it got fixed uh it this would sound little um dumb but so obviously it's a four legs and then it has a surface and other stuff so it could be a table right so uh and from a kid's perspective maybe he doesn't know that it's a table and then that's how he will explain and then and um so what we are looking at this features when we say uh we extracted three features out of this unknown so that is it has four legs it has a surface and there are screws with which these legs and um surface is fixed these are all features that it has extracted but still even though it has picked up all the features it doesn't know what it means because it doesn't have the information right um so now so provid machine learning is where it has the features it can it can either have the features being given are when it says unsupervised it extracts those features basing on looking at the image breaking it down to small smaller pieces and stuff and then maybe comparing those images with one another and say okay this has four legs and um there is another image which also has four legs so that's how it understand the whole images and then stores them now coming to the third category that is reinforcement machine learning here it uh again reinforcement machine learning is a category of learning where it depends on the way it um the model evolves right so yesterday we were discussing on on learning right in the learning there's also um the different steps as in acquiring uh the information retaining the information understanding the information adopting and U with necessary feedback of information we we will be able to

0:16:6 -  improve on top of our learning right so um in reinforcement machine learning either it could be supervised or unsupervised scenarios of data input because rainfor supervised unsupervised comes in basing on the input data that is coming in the data that is giving in is it labeled it's not labeled does it have output doesn't doesn't have output kind of Stu whereas reinforcement learning like Imaging model is in between is is behavior on the right side which helps in um in the model Improvement kind of stuff so either in supervised or un supervised it takes theut data and then it predicts something then it says okay uh then inad of just saying um yeah this is an image and I see an orange in it instead of saying it it would assume that there is there's a there's somebody like a guide there and say and ask it so saying okay I see this image are the set of images and I feel um all of them belong to Orange so is it correct or wrong so that gu says no this is not orange then it would uh take that feedback and then add it as an input saying okay this is not orange okay so it would remember saying okay something like these categories in in an image if it is like this this this so instead of learning what is an orange it it could learn like it is not an orange that is also important right so that um the possibilities are it could be something of the remaining kind of stuff so what it would do is anything with that features of this image it would if it is already there in Orange it will pull out of orange that is one learning so that's a wrong classification it has done because of the feedback that is coming in here it would it would pull out of oranges and then keep it separate and um it it tries to see what is the next probable um fruit that it could be and then it will assign that particular fruit because previously why did it say oranges as per the algor them the maximum probability for that particular image is is matching with orange that's reason it said orange but what it does is it will relearn re it will re design the algorithm in a way that it actually uh shifts its um overall output towards something else right so that's how it will tweak and then it

0:18:37 -  will it'll try to predict it again then it'll ask again is this an apple and uh if the the guy who is a guide or something like that would say yeah it is you're correct it is an apple then it's like yeah good so I know this is an Apple so now there are two things it would do is it knows that this is an apple and it also knows there are out of the all images how many of them are similar to this and it would actually try to classify our our confidently say okay these are all apples even though it knows all of them are apples it would it would in turn ask the in reinforcement learning it will take feedback on what it means and and basing on the feedback it will keep evolving and that's that goes in a trative process until uh the data is completely um classified with certain output in an efficient way uh that's reinforcement U machine learning so reinforcement machine learning primarily works on the feedback and stuff the feedback could be classified um it did not necessarily be a human feedback where um ma literally shows an image on the screen and says is it an orange and the human clicks on yes no kind of stuff it need not necessarily be human it could be um latest techniques it could also be another model um which could actually classify and say um for example um uh there's another model which knows the which knows about fruits um but reinforcement learning has been given images of everything where uh where it is it could be fruits it could be plants or anything then then the the other model can get also give a feedback right this model this model takes the images that are coming in and 'll process it and then basing on the knowledge it has about different kinds it would segregate them and and say this is a fruit firstly as as I said always the raw data and feature one on top of it because feature one could be like okay this has uh leaves this has a stem this is this is round in shape and it has some kind of a um um a holder like like an apple has the

0:21:12 -  thing right on top of it so um so it would it can extract those small small features here it is of red color it is of green color and other stuff and and on on top of it it will say okay all the ones which are having leaves all the ones which are red in color all the ones which are round those could be on on the third layer um and the fourth layer could be okay all um more aggregation like all the green with stems all the red circular like that and and on top of it they might it might say basing on it knowledge saying all those all these appear similar to maybe plants these are fruits something like that so once that is done it maybe it in the fruits it can in still apply saying it has these are apples or something like that and then after building all those layers it will then ask the guy whether it is right is it a plant and is it this particular plant kind of stuff and then it will take feedback and then again come back here and and then this time actually it will say um it to look at the path where it reached uh plants for example it would have said okay everything green um and uh everything of this size is actually a plant but everything green not necessarily of uh irres of the shape can't be a plant so if it would learn saying okay this particular thing is not a plant that means the features of this is it is green but actually it is in a it's in a circular shape so and it it doesn't have uh leaves those are the features of this one so for that it can't be planted so all those variants which has those fees will be moved away from plants and then it'll either be kept as unclassified or if it knows which is the next most closest uh like like a fruit right so it could be a green apple something like that so it it will try to move it there and then again try to learn from from it so that's the iterative way of learning and that's that comes under reinforcement uh machine learning so so input model output uh the supervised learning is is it the input where where it actually says the input data for training so training level

0:23:55 -  classification is supervised unsupervised as whereas um during training output prediction Level Training is is more on prediction level feedback based uh classification is called reinforcement learning this is what these three are three are not actually categories of the same segment but they are different kinds of approaches to machine learning kind of kind of stuff uh I think that is um very good understanding of supervisor un supervisor and enforcement machine learning uh now let's let's go pick up uh three algorithms in each and explain them uh supervised let's ask GPT on what is the top three algorithms for what are the toped so it says linear regression and then says d trees and then says random Forest okay so let's look at linear regression okay um each of them if it's Peak off it it is it takes a lot of time but um uh I'll I'll try to make it time bound and then um uh spend more time on um on linear regression um which is actually a basis and for everything um when I say everything there are lot of models that have evolved on on the similar um algorithm and how it works and also it goes like this so the algorithm or the approach to build that model could vary but the way we deal with training the algorithm to understand to to make the algorith them understand the data and uh to adopt to it so the way it retains the data and adopts to it depends on um it depends on how much it understands the data right how much it aligns with the data and stuff right so that process of it so picking up an algorithm and there are pieces where it it retains the data and adapts to the data and um and stuff is is is

0:26:31 -  actually similar process irrespective of the algorithms I would not say for everything but majority of them fall in that line so once you understand one algorithm the you can actually have a thinking where even though the algorithm name changes the approach to building an algorithm is is somewhat in a similar lines is is what it is so let's start off with linear regression um before I go to linear regression as part of machine learning linear regression is nothing but as I said again a Miss algorithm when given input data the algorithm understands the it it takes the information it understands what is there in the information and uh it analyzes on top of it on what uh information basing on the information that is provided it it forms those layers like okay feature one feature two feature three feature four how are the features intercorrelated to each other um how much the feature is is correlated to the output and U so basing on it the combinations of features being picked up and all that stuff and then it finally comes to the output right so the data um usually comes like this when I said features that is the input data that comes in um it will come with certain um features that is clear right so the input data uh either it could come with certain features or the the model that we pick up should be smart enough to understand what kind of feature how it can classify it and extract certain features out of it uh basing on um maybe if it is text each word can actually become a feature if it is an image each pixel can be a feature if it's an audio each each sound uh within it will become a feature if it's um uh if it's some sensor um like like a like a weather sensor or or some light sensor something like that each of the input light on off duration everything will be become a feature so um so so let's assume linear regression again is is mostly uh it's um it's a supervised uh machine

0:29:3 -  learning classification so one supervisor has different machine learning classifications um so what happens is um you have we let's assume that we have been given data which has all these features also lab like saying this is feature one this is feature two this is feature three this is feature four um and you have the output saying okay if for for feature 1 is equal to a feature 2 is equal to B feature 3 is equal to C and feature is equal to D then the output is it is a car okay so um or output you can call if it's you want to keep it as unknown you can call it y1 right so that means AB BC DC is y1 okay um but doesn't uh but it will not have one input right it will have multiple inputs like that AB B CD is y1 ABC e is Y2 CB d e is Y3 like that there could be multiple inputs that are given for the features feature one feature two feature three and then the corresponding outputs to it right um I mean even the outputs may not be necessarily different right it could also be similar like [Music] um feat there could be z a q e and that's also y1 so it's the outputs also could be similar basing on features right so because a certain set of features you you describe from one perspective and that's a car you describe some other features but still it's a car right so those those um uh those features features can also be similar similarity there should be features can be repeated values of the features can be repeated um yeah there there could also be similar similar features and even the output uh could also be same basing on what kind of output you have right so um that's more about data now what happens is this features that we have right so basing on the combination of those features we are predicting an output right so as we said in the learning we also look at uh machine machine learning the one of the key things yesterday that we learned

0:31:33 -  was it um it does um pattern recognition so that's I I I told you clearly that that is the key concept of the whole whole thing so going back to school time uh if you talk of pattern recognization our pattern I don't know how how far people are good with math but um but to explain in a simple logic um so they would actually tell you to explain about a circle what they would do is in a given space if you actually have a specific point and if you mark okay if you if you mark an equid distance Point like this if if you take uh something like a maybe use this bottle and if you you take let's say this is the center and then if you say if you mark a point like here right X and you mark all possible points which are at the same distance from this right right so those will become all the these are all the points right possible points so what will happen these all points together if you keep them keep them this all will become a circle right all those points if you connect them together uh that will even if you mark them you need not connect or draw a line kind of stuff if you mark all possible points around this particular single point they become a circle right so that's how and U now if if anyone gives you a point and says the classification is is it on a circle or is it not on a circle then all you do is you you take that point okay and uh you actually see what is the difference in between that point and uh and this center point because you you know it is there on the line of not right so what you do you calculate the distance between this point and the other point and if that point is anywhere less than this or if

0:34:6 -  it is anywhere greater than this that means it is not on the circle right so that is how you can actually say uh it is not on the circle right so what I'm trying to tell you is uh this is that is a pattern the pattern that people will observe is that they are given a if they given points which are in this circular fashion so you you can to represent those circular points um to to put all of those all of the to represent all of the points you can maybe you can also draw um a straight line okay but the straight line what happens uh the straight line doesn't correspond or actually represent all the points right the straight line would actually end up representing few points on on the either ends of the circle like if this is a circle if you draw a straight L like this only this point and this point on the C on the on the line rest of all the points are away but what we learn is in in um in the whole whole geometry and all that stuff what we learn is um the there are certain points and when to connect those points we draw we can draw a line connecting all those points right and for that line we can find out an equation right for for example for Circle we have all the points which are equid distance from this right and for all those points we can actually find out an equation for a circle similarly for there are certain points like this different points that are there in a straight line then you can draw a line once you draw a line across all the points you can actually find out an equation for this straight line similarly if there are multiple points which are distributed something like this right you you can actually put all those points and then find out an equation to complicate it you can also and um why do you find out like if there are certain points like this why do you find out uh why do you find out and when you find out an equation if you if you closely look at it for a straight line even for a straight line if there are some points

0:36:36 -  if you put it on a straight line it need not necessarily has all the points right agree so but we basing on the our three or four points that we have like we have 1 one 44 88 basing on 11 14488 we draw a line correct but does do we have all the points on the line no but we are saying basing on these three points that we have the the remaining points that are there could also be on straight line that's a pattern right need not necessarily be because it could be like um 1 one 44 88 and then the next points could be it could come down right like um for example 164 and then like I'm just I'm sorry um if I take an x coordinate and y coordinate which you guys are always familiar with right the the x is here and the Y is like this so when I say one one is X is one and Y is one is here right and then X X is 4 and Y is 4 is like this and then you have X is 8 and Y is 8 is like this so we basing on these three points that are there obviously what we think of is oh yeah this is a straight line right and we draw like line like this and then we assume that any other points that are coming in would be on would be also on the same line because that's the pattern in which it is going so we are not uh we are looking at a pattern on how those three points are and then we're trying to see that that maybe the out puts all all points are on the same line kind of stuff right that's pattern recognition right some some extent so basing on certain points we derive an equation but need not necessarily say that we need not we can't say that everything will fall on that line right so pattern recognition is basing on the current information that you have um but you you not 100% sure that everything falls on it but basing on the information that you have you actually say like for example even for for the circle right you don't know the center point here and you don't know this distance because if you know the center point you know the distance you can actually draw a circle but whereas

0:39:5 -  if you if you randomly know Point here with distance if you have a point here Point here Point here Point here you try to if you want to connect these you connect them like this and it will automatically become a circle connecting all those points um that's a wrong statement it not automatically become a c so maybe you can actually say okay I'll connect them with straight lines like this so maybe you have four points you can actually predict them like this so but what happens is when when there is another point that comes in it is outside right so um it doesn't fall to this pattern now what you do you you rebuild your pattern algorithm or equation saying okay now let's accommodate that point also so now you go like this right So eventually as as the points increase the amount of knowledge that is given to you information increase you instead of the straight lines when you when you get so now here these are the two points you can so you made it straight line like this but now you realize that you find two more points here then what happens you connect these these and even though it's even though there straight lines it is actually the form of a circle and more the points come you can actually see even though you have straight lines it will become almost similar to a circle so nobody can look at few points and exactly predic a circle right but they can actually incrementally learn that is the whole uh uh pattern recognization uh that happens I think whatever I've explained I'm not sure um how far it it it connects to your understanding but if it if it not U don't rely on exactly what I'm explaining but try to grasp the essence of the whole pattern recognition because the pattern recognization is the key concept underlying the complete machine learning um kind of stuff so uh coming back to linear regression in linear regression what what happens is we um we have those points that are there let's let's assume u i mean where I said X and Y um

0:41:40 -  so like X is one feature that is given in basing on that feature you try to predict it that's fine but reality is you don't have X right you have X X1 you have like this X1 then you have X2 and then you have X3 so it's it's multi-dimensional you have multiple points and then there is there is and there is some kind of correlation between all of them X1 X2 X3 could be there could be there could be not necessarily they should be but there could be uh that's one thing um um and and then there's also all of them together there's a correlation with y That's What is the pattern pattern that we want to find out right so our primary objective is to find out um pattern recogition between all these different X that we have and um in different dimensions and how are these connecting like X1 is here this point X2 is here so X1 and X2 together are here and that's correspond to set y I'm not sure how far this is visible but basing on X1 X2 there is there is some y but it need not necessarily be like X1 plus X2 and and both of them are equalent to Y it need not be but there could be like there there's a different metric to equalent of Y because X1 is here X2 is maybe here and Y is somewhere there somewhere above right so to equate X1 to X2 to Y to equate this or to to frame there should be an equation which will actually say Okay um I can't directly say X1 plus X2 equal to y That's Impossible because that may not be correct right so but in order to make it equalent to Y um what can I do is maybe I'll I'll say W1 X1 so that means instead of X1 if it is this small this small right X1 I'll I'll make it W1 X1 right certain mulp certain weight to bring it closer to Y and then I'll have W2 X2 I I'll give certain weight to um X2 and then instead of here it increase it here maybe not necessarily it should it

0:44:11 -  should always be an addition but let's say one one metric is in the algorithm is to add this two and see uh does it is it close to Y right so so what happened W1 X1 which is small like this you multiplied it and made it more closure to Y which is on this W2 uh sorry X2 you multiply with W2 so it comes much closer to Y which is maybe Beyond so combining these two do you get why but I gave I took specific I took specific X1 X2 and then Tred being y but the question is there are X1 has multiple values right X1 is not just one value it could be of different sizes different values that are there in X1 different dot X1 and there are different values in X2 like different X1 so for two of them you say okay for these X1 X2 when he has given in the in in a table format what will happen is he'll say X1 X2 this is value a b then y1 C D Y2 so what happens in the patternation you go and say okay W1 a plus w2b is equal to y1 and it is successful but that's not what we want to achieve because you can't when you say pattern pattern recognation classifies with every possible X1 with every possible X2 how do you derive the y1 Y2 Y3 y4 right so you can't actually say W1 A1 Plus W1 A2 B2 B is equal to y1 is is is you can't write uh you create pattern for one row you should actually accommodate a pattern which actually satisfies all of the row that means it can say a is y1 CD is Y2 D is Y3 all of them together should be accommodated into one line so what will happen is you have you you start writing um maybe to to make it less complicated what we usually do is we bring X2 and X1 all the X points into one particular Dimension so when I say one particular Dimension it's nothing but very simple so this is y this is X1 X2 X1 is X1 X1 this is X1 this is X2 let's say X2 features also I'll put them onto this layer like this

0:46:41 -  so both of them are on the same plan so and you look at it you and you not look at different dimensions like this X1 X2 X3 or something like that so I'll bring everything I'll project them to one single plan if you can't understand it's okay but what I'm saying is uh I'll bring them all all those points in space into one single X instead of calling X1 X2 X3 separately I'll make them X and then put them on one plane now once I put them onto one plane I I can actually correlate between those points and and Y right and uh basing on that I'll put a I I'll give I I'll draw a line Maybe all of them are on straight line okay all of them are closer to a straight line then I I'll draw straight line between them and then actually I'll see for each given X I'll try to predict y y is nothing but when I say a line as as my equation or pattern the Y point of each X that is there X is here it's not on the line because um we were using an equation we assuming saying if you draw a line all of the points are very close to the line or it's on the line so we are picking up that as our algorithm so drawing line it's nothing but an algorithm that we think is ma would be mapping X to Y but it may not necessarily be then then you see the line is not working out then you go for different equation so line is nothing but if you look at it it's an equation but y = mx plus C that's a line okay so you try to see does this equation satisfy or predict your y value properly or closely it it doesn't the points are little more complicated they're they're in different shape so then you pick up another equation right you can pick up something like maybe X1 s + X2 squ or x¬≤ um M into x¬≤ + C okay that's not a straight line that's different shape right so and then now you see is this MX S Plus C is it predicting properly like that you can have a number of equations and um basing on each equation

0:49:14 -  um you try to see how much the pattern recognition pattern recognition is nothing but set of x's to Y which is the equation that will actually help in pred predicting the given set of XS to Y right that's that's whole patternation works right so finding out that equations is what is the whole machine learning algorithms in linear regression what we do is we find this equations and then we put the put our so as as we discussed yesterday we can't assume that we have extensive set of data so we take certain amount of data which out of what we have we call it a training data and the remaining test data that is unknown data so we we at least we know that but we we think and assume that it is unknown and we first build an we try to recognize a pattern which is nothing but creating an equation which actually accommodates all the X to predict y I think this point is clear for everyone from my last 15 20 minutes of explanation I'm supposed to complete it in 5 minutes but I took more time to explain all that because um I I that's that's the core concept of U uh the whole machine learning pattern recognition which will in turn be converted into a uh that equation and that equation is nothing but the algorithm and that algorithm is nothing but the model and that model is nothing but our overall um machine learning output and that output in behavior is nothing but uh the outputs exhibited behavior is is is classified as intelligence and uh that out that model being run on a machine is called is is is is the way we look at it to exhibit that model running on a machine exhibiting intelligence is called artificial intelligence um I think if you if you connect this day one day two day three together that's where you you can actually see the big picture of artificial intelligence um so linear coming back to linear regression it is nothing but it is your identifying um given set of X points and Y points if

0:51:45 -  you identify uh an equation uh which actually aligns with the pattern that is there of the points as closely as possible then that equation will be taken as your your machine learning as the algorithm which helps in predicting why which is nothing but the model and if a future Point comes in we assume that the Future Point is on that particular line or or or or a circle or or some kind of that equation could be of some form right it could be a continuous line also like that right so when a future Point comes in we assume that that point is on that line is that the right thing it may or may not be but that is what the pattern says because all the 10 points that that they have given me all of the 10 points are on on the straight line either on the straight line are very close to particular straight line so I draw a straight line my assumption is tomorrow when he gives me X as uh 7 then basing on because I have 11 14488 so my when they give XS 7 my prediction will be Y is seven right because what I see the pattern is all of them are a straight line so the future points are coming in they they could also be in straight line is it the right thing again we don't know we just looking at pattern and then we we're resuming basing on the pattern this is what it is like like the way humans also does the same thing right so we look at four doors people have shown us doors for the first time you look at the four doors and somebody shows us another door which we classify as door basing on the information features that we have with respect to our handle with respect to the size with respect to the weight moves and stuff the we call it a door and uh we we again call it a door but we we may or may not be right correct because instead of a door it could be a window and and we still classify it as door so that's reason machine learning models need not necessarily be correct all the time because all it does is it it it picks up a pattern and then learns what it is so the way it could go wrong is um as I said it looked at four doors and then when I shown a window it actually calls

0:54:18 -  it a door but how does it learn better is instead of showing it four doors you show it 400 Red Doors it knows the door much better right it it knows how the door edges are uh it could also know how how much doors distance is from the um from the surface basing on this 400 doors and the probability that it will say this this window image that you have shared with me looks like a door but it it might not be the probability that it might not be will be higher because it's very that the 4 basing on the pattern features of the 400 door this is somewhere a little different from a door it could it could say but it would not be able to say what it is because it doesn't know right it doesn't have information saying what is window what are the kind of windows that are there but if you have list of if it is trained on 400 doors or 4,000 or 4 million doors and then if it's also trained on certain set of windows then when you give it an image it will classify and say because it already knows doors it already knows windows so basing on the features it would actually say okay this is a door this is a window again that's um again there there are two kinds uh I I think we are we will not be able to cover Deion trees and random Forest today uh we are with linear regression but the word regression um and and the examples that we're talking both are not same so that's a mistake um um regression and uh classification we call the second one like what is a window what is a door classification uh whereas regression is where um is nothing but you you have uh not certain set of uh y output variables right output variables y right what's saying y1 Y2 Y3 y4 if y1 Y2 Y3 y4 are can be categorized into certain segment like y1 Y2 Y3 are doors y4 y5 Y6 y7 y are windows then when the output is certain category then it's called classification saying either it is this this this then classification but if you if there is no correlation between the y1 Y2 I me there's no categorization in between Y

0:57:21 -  and they're different y1 is certain like like a numeric values right y1 is 44 Y is 50 fix Y3 is 0 y4 is minus 10 something that then those are different continuous different values then it is called regression okay so basing on the output you can call it as um regression or classification the those are two types and U basing on the output you you have different algorithms for for for example for for regression problems you have linear regression uh for classification problems you have different algorithms something like logistic regression and stuff those are classification problems um I think we are out of time uh yes we are close to out of time so um let's wrap it up for today um and we'll continue dish and trees and uh so even linear regression is not completely done um um so we'll move this today for okay I actually should move the whole of this today for um but I I we really spend a lot of time on this on day three to understand this but I I think these are foundational um I know this this took a long time we were actually explaining it in different level of detail but um this is must if this is missing your overall understanding of uh the machine learning um and algorithms and um and your overall understanding of arici engines uh if you don't have an understanding at this level of detail at least for the basic understanding U or foundational understanding of this Concepts if it's not to this level of detail you could still understand gen you could still understand deep learning you could still understand complex neural networks something like that but um there is certain amount of detail in this which you should assume you can't connect to it as much as stronger you this you're there in this Foundation once you are stronger in this
