# Day 5: Study Time Gen AI  
**Time Interval:** 00:00 - 37:25

## Summary
- **🔍 Overview**: The session recaps the previous lessons on **AI basics, machine learning**, and **linear regression**. The instructor aims to conclude linear regression and introduces **logistic regression**.
  
- **📐 Linear Regression Continuation**: The video continues the exploration of **linear regression**, focusing on how to **calculate loss** and introduce the concept of **cost function**. It discusses the **mean squared error** as an extension of the loss function, emphasizing its importance in refining algorithms.

- **🧠 Understanding Loss and Cost Functions**: The session emphasizes the significance of understanding **loss and cost functions** in machine learning. The loss function calculates the difference between expected and predicted outcomes, while the cost function helps in adjusting the model to minimize errors.

- **🛠 Practical Calculation**: The instructor goes through the process of **calculating cost** using squared differences, explaining how this impacts the model’s accuracy. They stress the importance of understanding these calculations to make informed decisions when adjusting models.

- **🎯 Optimization Process**: The session introduces the concept of **optimizing the model** by adjusting variables (W1, W2) to minimize the cost. It explains how to systematically reduce the cost function by adjusting the model's parameters.

- **🧮 Gradient Descent Introduction**: The instructor begins to introduce **gradient descent**, a method for finding the optimal values of W1 and W2 by **taking steps** in the direction that reduces the cost function. The session briefly touches on the mathematical foundation of this approach.

- **🚀 Next Steps**: The video concludes with a promise to delve deeper into **gradient descent** and its role in optimizing machine learning models in the upcoming session.
